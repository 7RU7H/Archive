# [[Side-Channel-Attacks]] Against Cryptography


[PDF NIST - Presentation Side Channels: Attacks, Defences, and Evaluation Schemes Part 1 - Attacks and Defences ](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2021/crypto-club-2021-side-channels-1/images-media/crclub-2021-side-channels-1.pdf), provide some insight into Post Quantum SCAs.


Notable information from reading [PDF NIST - Side-Channel Attacks: Ten Years After Its Publication and the Impacts on Cryptographic Module Security Testing ](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/physical-security-testing-workshop/documents/papers/physecpaper19.pdf):

- Control over the computation process
	- Active 
	- Passive
	- Invasiveness - Examples but no definition scale given 
		- Invasive
		- Semi-Invasive
		- Non-Invasive
- Module access
- Method in analytical process - which not classify the attack, but the research for the attack? - unless analysis is the attack and this is written weird
	- Simple side channel attack
	- Differential side channel attack
	- Output total 
		- `In case only one single output-value is used for an attack, then the attack is called first-order attack. If two or more output values for the same side-channel are used in an attack, then the attack is called second-order attack and higher-order attack`

Counter Measures proposed:
- De-correlate the output traces on individual runs (e.g., by introducing random timing
shifts and wait states, inserting dummy instructions, randomization of the execution of operations,
etc.);
- Replace critical assembler instructions with ones whose “consumption signature” is hard
to analyze, or re-engineer the critical circuitry which performs arithmetic operations or memory
transfers;
- Make algorithmic changes to the cryptographic primitives so that attacks are provably
inefficient on the obtained implementation, e.g., masking data and key with random mask
generated at each run.
