# Acoustic Attacks

[YouTube - DEF CON 25 - Matt Wixey - See no evil, hear no evil: Hacking invisibly & silently with light & sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFTiD7EnVjU) description: *"Traditional techniques for C2 channels, exfiltration, surveillance, and exploitation are often frustrated by the growing sophistication and prevalence of security protections, monitoring solutions, and controls. Whilst all is definitely not lost, from an attacker's perspective - we constantly see examples of attackers creatively bypassing such protections - it is always beneficial to have more weapons in one's arsenal, particularly when coming up against heavily-defended networks and highly-secured environments. This talk demonstrates a number of techniques and attacks which leverage light and/or sound, using off-the-shelf hardware. It covers everything from C2 channels and exfiltration using light and near-ultrasonic sound, to disabling and disrupting motion detectors; from laser microphones, to repelling drones; from trolling friends, to jamming speech and demotivating malware analysts. This talk not only provides attendees with a new suite of techniques and methodologies to consider when coming up against a well-defended target, but also demonstrates, in a hopefully fun and practical way, how these techniques work, their advantages, disadvantages, and possible future developments. It also gives details of real case studies where some of these techniques have been used, and provides defenders with realistic methods for the mitigation of these attacks. Finally, the talk covers some ideas for future research in this area."*


[YouTube - Matt Wixey - Sound Effects Exploring Acoustic Cyberweapons - DEF CON 27 Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftCULiYV7Wg) description: "*While recent research has explored the capability of attacks to cause harm by targeting devices â€“ e.g., SCADA systems, vehicles, medical implant devices - little consideration has been given to the concept of attacks affecting psychological and physiological health by targeting humans themselves. In a first-of-its-kind study, we assessed the capability of several consumer devices to produce sound at high and low frequencies which may be imperceptible to many people, as a result of remote and local attacks, and compared the resulting sound levels to maximum recommended levels. In doing so, we tested their viability as localised acoustic weapons which could cause temporary/permanent hearing damage and/or adverse psychological effects. We examined a number of countermeasures, including a tool to detect specified frequencies above specified thresholds. In this talk, I will cover the background of malware which has, intentionally or not, caused physical or psychological harm. I will explore previous research on the harmful effects of sound, focusing particularly on high and low frequencies, and some of the guidance which has been proposed to limit exposure to such sound. I will examine the use of imperceptible sound as applied to security research (covert channels, ultrasonic tracking beacons, etc), and will present our experiments and findings, including threat models, methodology, the attacks we developed, and the implications of our results. Finally, I will suggest a number of countermeasures and outline some possible areas for future research. Matt Wixey Matt is a PhD candidate at the Dawes Centre for Future Crimes, University College London, and leads technical research for the PwC Cyber Security practice in the UK. Prior to joining PwC, Matt led a technical R&D team for a law enforcement agency in the UK. His research interests include antivirus and sandboxing technologies, unconventional attack vectors, side-channels, and radio security.*"
