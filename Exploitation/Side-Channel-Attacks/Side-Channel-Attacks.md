# Side Channel Attacks

[Wikipedia Side Channel Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_channel_attack) describes *"a side-channel attack is any attack based on extra information that can be gathered because of the fundamental way a [computer protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_protocol "Computer protocol") or [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") is [implemented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation#Computer_science "Implementation")"*

[PDF NIST - Presentation Side Channels: Attacks, Defences, and Evaluation Schemes Part 1 - Attacks and Defences ](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2021/crypto-club-2021-side-channels-1/images-media/crclub-2021-side-channels-1.pdf): *"the terms side channel/ information leakage interchangeably and refer to any form of information that becomes available about something that was
meant to be kept secret."*

With advent of Cloud in the 2010s and commercial [[AI]] in the early 2020s (LLMs, DL, etc) notably [Ericsson Blog - Why side-channel analysis attacks are increasing and how to stop them](https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2023/4/side-channel-analysis) warns of: *"ML-enhanced SCA does not have to build algorithms from scratch but can benefit from algorithms prominent in identifying shapes and patterns in images."* LLM can provide analysis about analysis for SCAs. As result of commercialisation and semi-open sourcing of AI, combined with dependence advanced pools computational resources, architecture, infrastructure, XaaS - it makes the analysis and testing required for SCAs quicker and more accessible, with or without AI, although unlikely without All-in-one toolkit, device, libraries, etc.

**Please read**:
Consideration on sources. It is worth reminding the reader that there are no bug bounties for most of these attacks and there is Organisational insensitives to keep things secret or not fix or litigate for damages for claiming vulnerability. Also this leads to the weird end of academic research were potential anyone can claim things for prestige or competitive or personal reasons; (as more of a reminder to myself) measure twice, cut once - indicators are clues not facts and take a step back. Examples of Issues:
- White Paper's premise is that most SCA White Papers do not actually exploit with replicatable proof provide efficacy of how SCA were exploit. **The Author of the page cannot provide proof as to the truth of these statements**
	- [PDF On the Optimization of Side-Channel Attacks by Advanced Stochastic Methods - Werner Schindler: https://iacr.org/archive/pkc2005/33860084/33860084.pdf](https://iacr.org/archive/pkc2005/33860084/33860084.pdf) 
- Some papers are gated by pay walls
- Science is a voluntary effort - does not mean that paper are independently verified or verifiable
- Cost of anyone doing all the science and then making all of it free and public is Utopian

**Reader beware, I am not an expert** and if you are reading this then 99.99% chance you are not either this is just a idiot's attempt to summarise and classify, in the hope of formulating identification methodology for current and future SCAs.

## Terminology 

- **Trace(s)** [Ericsson Blog - Why side-channel analysis attacks are increasing and how to stop them](https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2023/4/side-channel-analysis): *"a collection of side-channel measurements over time while running a known process), often with targeted sensitive data that is constant, while known input or output data may vary between traces."*
	- [PDF NIST - Presentation Side Channels: Attacks, Defences, and Evaluation Schemes Part 1 - Attacks and Defences ](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2021/crypto-club-2021-side-channels-1/images-media/crclub-2021-side-channels-1.pdf): *"A trace consists of many points L = L(S) + R with X, k \* ⊂ S. Each data point is thus the 'sum' of data depending leakage (aka, signal) and data independent leakage (aka, noise)."*

- **Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)**
	- **TL;DR**: Signal is interpretable data; Noise is just noise
	- [PDF NIST - Presentation Side Channels: Attacks, Defences, and Evaluation Schemes Part 1 - Attacks and Defences ](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2021/crypto-club-2021-side-channels-1/images-media/crclub-2021-side-channels-1.pdf): *"One way to define a signal to noise ratio (SNR) is to base it on the variance of the 'data dependent' observable leakage (aka, signal) `Var(L)` over the variance of the 'data independent' observable leakage (aka, noise) `Var(R)`: `SNR = Var(L) / Var(R)`"*

## SCA Taxonomy 

[IBM's Taxonomy of Attackers (for SCAs) from  DG Abraham, GM Dolan, GP Double, JV Stevens, “Transaction Security System”, in IBM Systems Journal v 30 no 2 (1991) pp 206– 229](nolink) - source [Tamper Resistance - a Cautionary Note](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/tamper.pdf)
- Class I (clever outsiders)
- Class II (knowledgeable insiders)
- Class III (funded organisations)


Taxonomy of Side Channel Attacks from [Tamper Resistance - a Cautionary Note](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/tamper.pdf):
- Consumption-based
- Emission-based
- Physical
- Social


It is worth noting that attacks can be use in combination for Combinational Attacks (see section), [PDF NIST - Side-Channel Attacks: Ten Years After Its Publication and the Impacts on Cryptographic Module Security Testing ](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/physical-security-testing-workshop/documents/papers/physecpaper19.pdf) notes the following types of SCAs

- [[Timing-Attacks]]
- [[Fault-Attacks]]
- [[Power-Analysis-Attacks]]:
	- [PDF NIST - Presentation Side Channels: Attacks, Defences, and Evaluation Schemes Part 1 - Attacks and Defences ](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2021/crypto-club-2021-side-channels-1/images-media/crclub-2021-side-channels-1.pdf): *"Power/EM Leakage cannot be fully mitigated at the source: Producing perfectly balanced gates/wires is impossible, thus even with less leaky logic styles, there is some dependence between data and observable power/EM."*
- [[Electromagnetic-Attacks]]
- [[Acoustic-Attacks]]
- (Non)Visible [[Light-Attacks]]
- [[Error-Message-Attacks]]
- [[Cache-based-Attacks]]
- [[Frequency-based-Attacks]]
- [[Scan-based-Attacks]]

[[Side-Channel-Attacks-Against-Cryptography]]

[PDF NIST - Presentation Side Channels: Attacks, Defences, and Evaluation Schemes Part 1 - Attacks and Defences ](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2021/crypto-club-2021-side-channels-1/images-media/crclub-2021-side-channels-1.pdf): Hardware SCAs are also termed as Physical SCAs 


[Wikipedia - Side Channel Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack) claims the following not included in the NIST White paper (**Author notes none of these have references (as of 01/10/2024), but they seem legitimate..**):
- [Data remanence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_remanence "Data remanence") — in which sensitive data are read after supposedly having been deleted. (e.g. [Cold boot attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack "Cold boot attack"))
- Software-initiated fault attacks — Currently a rare class of side channels, [Row hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer "Row hammer") is an example in which off-limits memory can be changed by accessing adjacent memory too often (causing state retention loss).
- [Allowlist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allowlist "Allowlist") — attacks based on the fact that the allow-listing devices will behave differently when communicating with allow-listed (sending back the responses) and non-allow-listed (not responding to the devices at all) devices. Allowlist-based side channel may be used to track Bluetooth MAC addresses.
- Optical - in which secrets and sensitive data can be read by visual recording using a high resolution camera, or other devices that have such capabilities (see examples below)

**Author notes and ideas while researching - please dismiss if forget to tidy up**
- Mode Shift attacks - force it into debug mode
- Informational SCAs - there is probably a white paper with the name of this that already exists, ideas for future reviewing to fix and build out these and other sections
	- Dorking as an informational in-and-exfiltration?
	- Artefact-Identifying attacks - like [YouTube - DEF CON 26 - Matt Wixey - Betrayed by the Keyboard How What You Type Can Give You Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt17ZlQbF9o) 


## Exploiting Side Channel Attacks

Device is superpositional term here to replaceable with whatever type of target 

- Schema dependent expertise:
	- [[Electronics]], [[Acoustics]], [[Social-Engineering]], etc
- Enumeration
	- Schematics, (meta) knowledge about device, architecture information, documentation, patents
	- [[Reverse-Engineering]] 
- Replication 
	- Multiple duplicates of target device, multiple environmental controls


Inputs and Traces? [PDF NIST - Presentation Side Channels: Attacks, Defences, and Evaluation Schemes Part 1 - Attacks and Defences ](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2021/crypto-club-2021-side-channels-1/images-media/crclub-2021-side-channels-1.pdf):
> A single trace from one input offers multiple (exploitable) targets. Adversaries can often acquire more than one trace. Attacks can take advantage of>
>  - single input / single target (little use for key recovery)
>  - single input / multiple targets
>  - multiple inputs / single target
>  - multiple inputs / multiple targets

Differential Attack? 
Profiling (multiple simultaneously) targets [PDF NIST - Presentation Side Channels: Attacks, Defences, and Evaluation Schemes Part 1 - Attacks and Defences ](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2021/crypto-club-2021-side-channels-1/images-media/crclub-2021-side-channels-1.pdf): 
> - single input / multiple target
> - differential inputs (with or without profiling)/ single target
> -  profiling: differential inputs / multiple target

SNR 
- [PDF NIST - Presentation Side Channels: Attacks, Defences, and Evaluation Schemes Part 1 - Attacks and Defences ](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2021/crypto-club-2021-side-channels-1/images-media/crclub-2021-side-channels-1.pdf):  *"the higher the signal in relation to the noise, the better attacks can be"* **. A**-*"ssuming we can exploit the signal."*
- SNR Strategies involve: 
	1. Maximise the exploitation of the available signal 
	2. ..and if possible simultaneously decrease the noise
- Optimising SNR 
	- Acquire as much signal as possible
	- Exploit as many targets as computationally feasible
	- Utilise several traces (to reduce the per-trace-noise and to increase the information about the key).
