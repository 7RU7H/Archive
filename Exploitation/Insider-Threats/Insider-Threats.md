From [thehackernews.com Insider Threats in SaaS ](https://thehackernews.com/2024/08/suspicious-minds-insider-threats-in.html)

According to [CSA research](https://www.adaptive-shield.com/landing-page/the-annual-saas-security-survey-report-2025-ciso-plans-and-priorities/?utm_source=thehackernews&utm_medium=sponsored_content&utm_campaign=thn_detectinginsideractivity_1), 26% of companies who reported a SaaS security incident were struck by an insider.
- **Data Theft or Data Exfiltration:** Excessive downloading or sharing of data or links, particularly when sent to personal email addresses or third parties. This may occur after an employee has been laid off and believes the information could be useful in their next role, or if the employee is very unhappy and has malicious intentions. The stolen data may include intellectual property, customer information, or proprietary business processes.
- **Data Manipulation**: The deletion or modification of critical data within the SaaS application, potentially causing financial loss, reputational damage, or operational disruption.
- **Credential Misuse**: Sharing of login credentials with unauthorized users, either intentionally or unintentionally, allowing access to sensitive areas of the SaaS application.
- **Privilege Abuse:** A privileged user takes advantage of their access rights to modify configurations, bypass security measures, or access restricted data for personal gain or malicious intent.
- **Third-Party Vendor Risks:** Contractors or third-party vendors with legitimate access to the SaaS application misuse their access.
- **Shadow Apps:** Insiders install unauthorized software or plugins within the SaaS environment, potentially introducing vulnerabilities or malware. This is unintentional but is still introduced by an insider.

- Dummy Data created pre-enagement as target for the objective to exfiltrate
- Dummy Data created pre-enagement as target for the objective to modify
- Demonstrate credential misuse ease with fake accounts 
- Demonstrate abuse of privileges
- Create fake application with in lab to create alerts and informationals based on the weirdness of adding the shadow app to any build would be
- Demonstrate Third-Party abuse in a lab to create alerts and informationals based on the weirdness of adding the shadow app to any build would be
