# Upload Vulnerabilities

[PortSwigger File Upload Vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload): 
*"File upload vulnerabilities are when a web server allows users to upload files to its file system without sufficiently validating things like their name, type, contents, or size. Failing to properly enforce restrictions on these could mean that even a basic image upload function can be used to upload arbitrary and potentially dangerous files instead. This could even include server-side script files that enable remote code execution. In some cases, the act of uploading the file is in itself enough to cause damage. Other attacks may involve a follow-up HTTP request for the file, typically to trigger its execution by the server."*

## Tools

1. Content Discovery Tool - `feroxbuster`, `gobuster`, `dirb`, `dirbuster`, `ffuf`, `wfuzz`.. plus `gospider` to find where to upload forms and where uploaded files will end up
2. Wappalyzer - For some information
3. Burp - Intercept upload requests to configure the request to bypass and/or trick the server.

[[DAVtest]] tests WebDAV enabled servers by uploading test executable files
[[Curl-Cheatsheet]] for:

```bash
curl "http://$IP" -X OPTIONS -I # Get all the options
curl -T '/path/to/local/file.txt' 'https://example.com/test/'  
curl --upload-file <file> http://<IP>/test/<filename>
```

## Considerations


Beware the some methods are damaging to data, a shell is potential damaging. PoC should be least harmful to the server. Always be aware: **Overwriting existing files on a server** - if file permission on the server are lacking, location of file path found and information disclosure as to of file name. **Is it in scope to overwrite files**. Just because you can does not mean you should, just upload (or ask nicely for) a file that you can then overwrite without destroying data.

## Questions to ask..


- File uploads?
	- Are we be diligent in get feedback from our actions with proxying tools?
	- Can we get the source code and read it properly?
	- What languages does the server or connected systems like parsers for xml, JavaScript use?
	- Can we just use `PUT`? 
		- BurpSuite: `Proxy -> Options -> Intercept Client Requests`
	- How does the web servers handle requests for static files?
	- How is the web server handing HTTP Headers see [[HTTP]] 
		- use `curl "http://$IP/page" -X OPTIONS -I`
	- How is the web server handling static files?
		- Executable Or Non-Executable
			- Non-Executable: the server may just send the file's contents to the client in an HTTP response.
			- Executable: server must be configured to executed that file type it will respond to the client
				- Else it is not configured and will respond with an Error
			- Is the file type executable or modifiable to be executable after upload or during?
	- Do we have file execution?
		1. Accessible directory 
		2. Vulnerable parameter with the uploaded file are argument
		3. [[Server-Side-Request-Forgery]] or [[Path-Traversal]] to force execution 
		4. Injection attack to force execution
		5. Download?
	- Where is the filtering occurring client or server side?
		-  Bypassing Client-Side filtering
			1.  Turn off JavaScript in your browser
			2.  Intercept and modify the incoming page
			3.  Intercept and modify the file upload
				1. Change:
					1. Content-Type 
						- [Portswigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload) states: *"The `Content-Type` response header may provide clues as to what kind of file the server thinks it has served. If this header hasn't been explicitly set by the application code, it normally contains the result of the file extension/MIME type mapping."*
					1. *filename=*-like-parametres argument to acceptable
			4.  Send the file directly to the upload destination
		- Bypassing Server-Side filtering
			1. Change or embedded the file extension within accepted extension
			2. Change magic number
			3. Change name with encoding or multiples of encoding 
			4. Change the content, length of file
				1. encoding
				2. compression
	- What could be being validated? 
		0. Is the directory where stored writable?
		1. What blacklisting or filtering could be implemented?
			2. Extension validation - only want a .specific extension, can append **after** or **before**
				1. Check for `.phpX` and `.phar` variations for relevant language some have lots
				2. Can be obfuscate file extensions like .aSpx on windows (as windows is case insensitive) be parsed as .aspx
				3. Can we stack file extensions - `exploit.php.jpg`?
					1. With encodings?
						1. URL? Double URL?
						2. multibyte unicode characters:
							- *Sequences like `xC0 x2E`, `xC4 xAE` or `xC0 xAE` may be translated to `x2E` if the filename parsed as a UTF-8 string, but then converted to ASCII characters before being used in a path.* [PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload#how-do-web-servers-handle-requests-for-static-files)
					2. With `;` or `%00` - `exploit.asp;.jpg` or `exploit.asp%00.jpg` - because the server process is C/C++ and these being line/string termination characters
			3. File type validation? 
				0. `Content-Type` Header
				1. MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension) validation 
				2. Magic number validation - first bytes of file, `hexedit` to edit in hex.
			5. File length validation - checks on file length
			6. File name validation - bad chars like control chars, slashes, null bytes
				5. Is the server storing files in a way that is guessable (storing files by naming with an MD5 hash)?
			7. File content validation? 
				- [Wikipedia File Signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) - Files types have signature set of bytes to make them unique amongst other types
		1. Is the directory were files store user-accessible? 
		1. Is there potentially a race condition?
			1. Is there a custom file validation mechanisms instead of or used in parallel to a framework with temporary/sandboxing destination to which validation checks are performed before storage (hopeful with unguessable file name)?
			2. URL-based file uploads with custom file validation mechanisms
	- Can be bypass File Execution prevention - can we treat the file upload as just *write* not write and be executed by?
		- If there is a file upload vulnerability upload a blank `.htaccess`? 
		- If you can create a new directory on upload make new directory?
		- Is there another page that execute a file that can reach the uploaded file?
			- Is there an File inclusion vulnerability?
		- Do we need to privilege escalated on the web application to execute a file?  
	- Do need top upload malicious client-side scripts like an XSS payload, because we can't have execution over the server? 
	- Is the parser of `.doc` or `.xls` files vulnerable to XXE injection attacks from our uploaded malicious file?

## Impact and Mitigations

[PortSwigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload#how-do-web-servers-handle-requests-for-static-files):
- Check the file extension against a whitelist of permitted extensions rather than a blacklist of prohibited ones. It's much easier to guess which extensions you might want to allow than it is to guess which ones an attacker might try to upload.
- Make sure the filename doesn't contain any substrings that may be interpreted as a directory or a traversal sequence (`../`).
- Rename uploaded files to avoid collisions that may cause existing files to be overwritten.
- Do not upload files to the server's permanent filesystem until they have been fully validated.
- As much as possible, use an established framework for preprocessing file uploads rather than attempting to write your own validation mechanisms.


The impact of file upload vulnerabilities:
- What property of the file that is uploaded does not get validated
- What HTTP Method configuration and client-server model context allows for uploading
- What file permissions does the file have once uploaded

PHP upload vulnerability prevention:
- `md5sum` or `shasum` the files and store them as the \*-sum string for pseudo random filenames, which remove control over the extension. 
- Disable PHP wrappers, file could be archived as .zip, but then unzipped PHP wrappers with the extension then usable 
- Complexify the summing as function `md5($data_uploaded, $store_id, $user_id, $filename)`
	- `$data_uploaded`, `$store_id` - like a Salt
	- `$user_id`, `$filename` - prevent collision with other files
