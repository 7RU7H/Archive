# Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[Portswigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) *Cross-site request forgery (also known as CSRF) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform. It allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.*

Three key conditions:
- A Relevant Action
- Cookie-based session handling
- No unpredictable request parameters

PortSwigger - attacker would construct a web page to reflect the scenario:
- A Relevant Action - Change Email
- Cookie-based session handling - `Cookie: session=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
- No unpredictable request parameters - `email=`

If a victim users visits this page then it would trigger the user to then perform an unintentional action of change the email address of the legitimate site that they are registered with.. beware a delivery method is required to get the user to visit the attackers page.
```html
<html> 
<body> 
<form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change" method="POST"> <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net" /> 
</form> 
<script> document.forms[0].submit(); </script> 
</body> 
</html>
```

## Defences, Prevention, Mitigation of CSRF

- CSRF Tokens
- SameSite Cookies
- Referer-based validation
