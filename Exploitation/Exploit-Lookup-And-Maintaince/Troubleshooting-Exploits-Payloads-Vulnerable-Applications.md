# Troubleshooting Exploits, Payloads, Vulnerable Applications

This article was born from firstly my learning to improve at scripting and editing exploits with the hope one day to be able to find and write exploits myself - **and** Ippsec released [Troubleshooting failed RCE Payloads by Debugging Python Web Applications - Noter Beyond Root](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eojA9k4px-8). This is the seed for this article that will probably expand out

## Ippsec 

1. Get the application on your own machine
1. Consider the context of the application is originally running 
	- If that context affects how the exploit will end up, after exploiting it local - changing it to fit the actual context.
1. Make it run locally and properly; simulate external actions, bypass issues or connect to actually if safe
	- If you can tunnel back to any databases; requires ssh, just `-L 3306:localhost:3306`, references the Konami Sans Article which is explained in more depth here: [[SSH-Cheatsheet]]
	- Create Users of various level of privilege.
1. Review Source Code
	1. Check where and what you are exploiting and its interconnections within the application
1. Run the application in VScode, exploit and review and the errors attempted to trying to exploit the application.
	1. Stop and think about the errors
	2. Use breakpoint in VScode
	3. Use the debug console
	4. Attempt Exploit
	5. Repeat.
