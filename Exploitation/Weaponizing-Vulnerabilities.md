# Weaponizing Vulnerabilities


## Exploits

- Form
	
- Transportation

- Localised point of exploitation


[Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)](https://www.dc3.mil/Missions/Vulnerability-Disclosure/Vulnerability-Disclosure-Program-VDP/) uses the [Lifecycle of a Vulnerability Framework](https://thescif.org/lifecycle-of-a-vulnerability-overview-part-one-374a01c73096?gi=8ba01d1d3d89) to model migation and remediation of vulnerabilities.
- Product Launched
- Vulnerability Discovery (Private or Public)
	- 0-day a exploit yet to be made public; 
	- N-Day is exploit signifying the Nth number of days since patch release   
- Development of a Proof of Concept
- Patch Development or Update
- Patch Release
- Patch Install


## Exploit Chaining

Expoit Chaining is the technique of utilizing multiple exploits for vulnerabilities to gain complete control of a target system.

- Recon - [[Active-Recon]] and [[Passive-Recon]]
- Inital Exploitation 
- [[Privilege-Escalation]]
- [[Persistence]]
- [[Lateral-Movement]]
- Romote Code Execution - so that persistence mechanisms are accessible to regain [[Privilege-Escalation]] remotely post compromise
