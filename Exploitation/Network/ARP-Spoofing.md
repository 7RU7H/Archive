# ARP Spoofing

[ARP spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing), ARP cache poisoning or ARP poison routing is Man-In-The-Middle Attack ([[MITM-Attacks]]) technique where an adversary. THM's *tl;dr  "an attacker sends (spoofed) ARP messages […] to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another host […] causing any traffic meant for that IP address to be sent to the attacker instead. ARP spoofing may allow an attacker to **intercept** data frames on a network, **modify** the traffic, or stop all traffic. Often the attack is used as an opening for other attacks, such as denial of service, **man in the middle**, or session hijacking attacks."* - [Wikipedia - ARP spoofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARP_spoofing)
