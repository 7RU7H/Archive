# Binary Exploitation Protections

## DEP

[Data execution prevention](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/data-execution-prevention) (DEP) is a system-level memory protection feature that is built into the operating system, DEP enables the system to mark one or more pages of memory as non-executable. If code is attempted to be run from this location, memory access violation exeception occurs, and if the exception is not handled, the calling process is terminated.

## ASLR Enumeration

[Address space layout randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) (ASLR) randomizes the address spaces positions of stack, heap and libraries upon execution to prevent predetirmination by attacker to exploit fuzzing memory addresses.


- **Linux**

```bash
cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```
But when exploiting clib functions, or any libraries BEWARE of lack of machine knowledge; where is the function that is in address space or pointer address.

- **Windows**

XP is the last version of Windows that does not have ASLR.

## Control flow integrity CFG
Implementation of that validates indirect code branching, preventing overwrites of function pointers.


## Stack canaries
