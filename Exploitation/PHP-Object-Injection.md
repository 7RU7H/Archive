# PHP-Object-Injection

Learn about PHP injection from [Ippsec HackTheBox SwagShop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qECG2_8xw_s), the page does not spoil the box or the lessons that can be learnt from it.

Essentially a serialisation and deserialisation vulnerability. This vulnerability stems from a deserialisation functionality that is pass a serialised object and then a php gadgets that can execute php, based on the handling of that object post-deserialisation. The example given by Ippsec is a  regular expression with a execute flag in older php version `/replacethis/withthis/g,e`, such that during parsing can be hijacked by the php code embedded in the object.
