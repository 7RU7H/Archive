# Chaining-Exploits


1. Use the application like a normal user
2. Recursively enumerate and find weaknesses (pre-auth), (auth), (admin)
3. Understand what each finding enables
	- "What can I do with this if I assume nothing else is broken?"
4. What is the objective?
5. Build a path from Weaknesses to Objective
6. Execute and Validate each step
	- Walk the chain in order. Don't assume something will work; test it.
7. Report the full chain
