# Using Public Exploits

You may need to fix the exploit see: [[Fixing-Public-Exploits]]

**BEWARE CONTEXT AND WHAT IS STATED BY AUTHORS AND IN EXPLOITS**
**Always Read and convert hex always**
**Use extreme caution when using exploits from non-curated resources!**

## Online

https://www.exploit-db.com/
https://packetstormsecurity.com/
https://bugtraq.securityfocus.com/rss/index.shtml

- [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) - if there is no direct CVE to code, it probably is a rabbithole from Offsec
Github is not code reviewed, review code with care. 

## Either

Try ports of exploits that are part of a C2 from the [[C2-Matrix]]

## Offline

**Searchsploit**

Useful searchsploit commands
```bash
searchsploit -x $exploit # examine `more` command view; q to quit
searchsploit -m $exploit # copy to current director
```

Remember to check [https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb-bin-sploits](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb-bin-sploits) i.e:

```bash
# We mirror the below
42315.py # eternalblue, but require classes not avaliable:
wget https://github.com/offensive-security/exploitdb-bin-sploits/raw/master/bin-sploits/42315.py
mv 42315.py.1 mysmb
```

**NSE scripts**

[[Nmap-AllTheScripts]] and [[Nmap-Cheatsheet]] is sometimes all you need, but beware at some point you may face IPS and IDS or Firewalls that perform deep packet inspection, Nmap won't work unless you have be allowed to. Nmap packets state that they are Nmap packets in nice plain text.

## Precompiled Binaries

[0xdf](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2019/03/05/htb-devel.html) : *"Precompiled exploits require keyboard access or remote desktop."*  Therefore see [[Compiling-Exploits]] . For example [abatchy17 is a legend](https://github.com/abatchy17/WindowsExploits), but sometimes for stability, replicatability and less human error, especially for old windows kernel exploits - sometimes its best to use [[Metasploit]]
