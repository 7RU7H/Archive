# Client Side Attack Targeting

The secret to success in client-side attacks is ...accurate and thorough information gathering. Combining both [[Active-Recon]] and [[Passive-Recon]]. Very much [[Haddix-Methodology]] or [[Mechanizing-The-Methodology]]: start external addresses and domain names and work towards system configuration and network setup - note those talk web-app bug hunting, but the methodology is only really different in the end point and scoping.

Active Client Information Gathering more invasive and direct attacks of [[Phishing]] and [[Active-Recon]] to enumerate and extract as much information from user or machine.

## Social Engineering and Client-Side-Attacks

Just read [Hadnagy]](https://www.social-engineer.com/social-engineer-team/christopher-hadnagy/)'s "Social Enigeering: The Art of Human Hacking". Second Edition worth it. He also founded [innocentlivesfoundation](https://www.innocentlivesfoundation.org/our-team/chris-hadnagy/) to **"Our mission is to identify anonymous child predators to help bring them to justice."** - Please donate, buy his books, learn and help other to make the world a safer place.

Like all hacking it requires time and patience. Methodical exfiltration not a *0day-bruteforce-yolo-one-line-of-code/phase-human/machine-ismine'*. It more like Heartbleed slow extraction and pieces together with all redirection and caution and crafted requests to achieve a goal many steps deep from current point of attack. 
For example `Recon Targets:Systems/Persons -> \*hishing & Pretexting -> Source tooling/exploits/Human access based on extracted information ->  -> VBscript macro to whaled person's workstation -> Network hacking`. Similarly to all the talks regarding methodology a recursive looping of enumeration and attack path analysis phases occur.

## Client Fingerprinting

[Fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint) is a term used to describe the process of target gathering information about a specific machine or software to identify it.
