# Client Side Attack Targeting

The secret to success in client-side attacks is ...accurate and thorough information gathering. [[OSINT]] with combination of both [[Active-Recon]] and [[Passive-Recon]] as what client and how it can be exploited is vital to succes. Very much [[Haddix-Methodology]] or [[Mechanizing-The-Methodology]]: start external addresses and domain names and work towards system configuration and network setup - note those talk web-app bug hunting, but the methodology is only really different in the end point and scoping.

Active Client Information Gathering more invasive and direct attacks of [[Phishing]] and [[Active-Recon]] to enumerate and extract as much information from user or machine.

## Social Engineering and Client-Side-Attacks

Just read [Hadnagy](https://www.social-engineer.com/social-engineer-team/christopher-hadnagy/)'s "Social Enigeering: The Art of Human Hacking". Second Edition worth it. He also founded [innocentlivesfoundation](https://www.innocentlivesfoundation.org/our-team/chris-hadnagy/) to **"Our mission is to identify anonymous child predators to help bring them to justice."** - Please donate, buy his books, learn and help other to make the world a safer place.

Like all hacking it requires time and patience. Methodical exfiltration not a *0day-bruteforce-yolo-one-line-of-code/phase-human/machine-ismine'*. It more like Heartbleed slow extraction and pieces together with all redirection and caution and crafted requests to achieve a goal many steps deep from current point of attack. 
For example `Recon Targets:Systems/Persons -> \*hishing & Pretexting -> Source tooling/exploits/Human access based on extracted information ->  -> VBscript macro to whaled person's workstation -> Network hacking`. Similarly to all the talks regarding methodology a recursive looping of enumeration and attack path analysis phases occur.

## Reconnaissance

- [[Search-Engine-Dorking]]  the target domain by publicly available filetype `site:example.com filetype:pdf`
	- If active reconnaissance is acceptable then use a content discovery tool directory bust by extension
- `Exiftool` to acquire Metadata tags of public available documents (often unsanitized) - [https://exiftool.org/TagNames/](https://exiftool.org/TagNames/)
	- Names, Versions, Dates


```bash
# -a display duplicated tags
# -u display unknown tags
exiftool -a -u $file.pdf
```

## Client Fingerprinting

[Fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint) is a term used to describe the process of target gathering information about a specific machine or software to identify it.

## Pretext

A pretext frames a situation in a specific way. [[Pretexts]] are narrative to set context such that in [[Social-Engineering]] the result is potentially ensure the execution of [[Client-Side-Attacks]] through the participant target of the engagement.
