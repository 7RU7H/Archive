# Fixing Exploits
1. Alway read the Exploit code before initial use
2. Sometimes modifications are needed for the different context than a some stated Public Exploits
3. Refactoring Exploits to another language to make use of a library or feature of the language 

## Refactoring considerations
How each language handles strings, buffers, memory allocation.

## Compilation Considerations
Indications by library as where and how the exploit was originally compiled.
Get a cross compiler `mingw-64 cross-compiler`.

## Garbage Collector Considerations

## Memory Consideration
Recreate target environment locally with a VM and use  debugger to detirmine memory related considerations. Otherwise we have to really on public knowledge. `msfpescan` exists, but so does [[Radare2]] and [[Ghidra]]

## Fixing Memory Corruption Exploits

## Stack based exploits

#### Without  Memory Corrupt Protection
Exploit:
1. Create a large buffer to store payload and prime the memory corruption
2. Hijack EIP with padding til offset to overwrite a return address on stack
3. Add an optional prepended NOP sled to the payload
4. JMP `REGISTER` (ESP,...) to redirect the execution flow to the beginning address onf the payload on the stack.

Prefixing:
1. Best and healthy practice to locate return address personally, not trust the exploit code.
2. May just be best to exclude obvious bad characters
3. Check the endianness of hardware and exploit code!

Fixes/Modification considerations:
1. Any additions retraction alter the offset! Add or remove padding to accommodate additional variables like File paths, IP addresses, ports, URLs, etc.
2. Payload may need to modification or replacing **AGAIN** adjust for size changes, general bes to replace entirely for safety.
3. Bad Character enumeration.
4. Locations of return address need to be places programatically reachable else you probably should have check this in prefixing part 1.
5. Double check the endianness of any additions
6. Be aware of how the language assign buffers  and string handling(string termination in C with 0x00) if you need to change size.
