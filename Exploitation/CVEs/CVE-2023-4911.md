# CVE-2023-4911

The [Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU)](https://www.qualys.com/2023/10/03/cve-2023-4911/looney-tunables-local-privilege-escalation-glibc-ld-so.txt) on the 3rd of October, 2023 identified a critical flaw in the GNU C Library's dynamic loader (`ld.so`). This vulnerability would allow for [[Privilege-Escalation]] on modern and major Linux distributions that use use glibc (basically most distributions). 

[[ELF-Binaries]] use shared libraries, which has the extension:`.so`, to load shared libraries of `c` functions and link them to an executable to be used when required. Shared Libraries are the equivalent of `.dll`s on Windows, they reduce the size of binaries and improve performance (one library of code to optimise). 

The `.interp` section is for location of its required loader to specified so the kernel can use that specific loader - the reason this vulnerability is so bad is that most Linux OSes uses this loader. See the [ld.so documentation](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/ld.so.8.html) for more information about `ld.so`.
