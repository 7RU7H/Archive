# LocalPotato

The vulnerability, dubbed Local Potatoc can allow an attacker with a low-privilege account on a Windows host to read/write arbitrary files with SYSTEM privileges. It is a local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability in Windows was reported to Microsoft on September 9, 2022, by Andrea Pierini ([@decoder_it](https://twitter.com/decoder_it)) and Antonio Cocomazzi ([@splinter_code](https://twitter.com/splinter_code)). The vulnerability would allow an attacker with a low-privilege account on a host to read/write arbitrary files with SYSTEM privileges.

On February 13, another privilege escalation PoC was published by [BlackArrowSec](https://twitter.com/BlackArrowSec) that abuses the `StorSvc` service, allowing an attacker to execute code as SYSTEM as long as they can write a DLL file to any directory in the system's `PATH`.

LocalPotato [PoC](https://decoder.cloud/2023/02/13/localpotato-when-swapping-the-context-leads-you-to-system/) leverages the flaw in a special case of [[NTLM-Authentication]] called NTLM local authenication to trick privileged process into authenticating a session the attack started against a local SMB Server. If sucess the Attack can connect to the `C$` and `ADMIN$` shares.

## Exploit Chain

TIL: Attacker MITMs both client and server to get the Client's Privileged Context to then be able to Read/Write on all network shares in the network

1. Trigger a privileged process to connect to a rogue server (usually as SYSTEM user) under our control
2. The rogue server will instantiate a `Security Context`, delaying connection back to then MITM both client and server.
	-  Privileged Client -> NTLM Type 1 -> ...Rogue Server (Rogue Server for Privileged Client and Rogue Client for SMB Server)
	- Rogue Server:
		1. Inititate Context ID A 
		2. Swap Context A to Rogue Client
		3. Route Client -> Initualize a connection with Context ID A-> SMB Server
		4. Rogue Server will await SMB Server's response - Context ID B (SMB Server Context)
		5. Rogue Client -> Swap Context ID B -> Rogue Server
		6. Rogue Server -> Send Context ID B -> Privileged Client
	- Attacker keeps Context ID A and can now access any network share with SYSTEM Privileges

## StorSvc Abuse

 [BlackArrowSec](https://twitter.com/BlackArrowSec) that abuses the `StorSvc` service, allowing an attacker to execute code as SYSTEM as long as they can write a DLL file to any directory in the system's `PATH`.
1. Send an RPC call to the `SvcRebootToFlashingMode` method provided by the `StorSvc` service
2. This will trigger an attempt to load a missing DLL called `SprintCSP.dll`
3. `StorSvc` runs with SYSTEM privileges, creating SprintCSP.dll somewhere in the `PATH` will get it loaded whenever a call to `SvcRebootToFlashingMode` is made

## Detection

[[YARA]] rule:
```json
rule detect_localpotato {
    meta:
        description = "Detects the localpotato exploit"
    strings:
                $CLSID = "854A20FB-2D44-457D-992F-EF13785D2B51"
		$localpotato = {6c 6f 63 61 6c 70 6f 74 61 74 6f}
		$ntlm = {4e 54 4c 4d}
		$function = "NtQueryInformationProcess"

    condition:
        all of them
}
