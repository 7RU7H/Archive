# Software Supply Chain Attacks



## Prevention and Mitigation

#### SLSA Framework

**Author's opinion:** `If building contains sub-components that are randomised this framework will not work entirely and will require additional hashing of components that have variance on build time as those will result in different hash.`

[TrailOfBits - Securing the software supply chain with the SLSA framework](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/10/01/securing-the-software-supply-chain-with-the-slsa-framework/ "Securing the software supply chain with the SLSA framework") blog discuss SLSA for the purpose of *support for SLSA provenance to PyPI* in a drafting a specification to provide protocol in preventing Supply Chain Attacks; It requires, a Provenance File, Build Levels and Verification Process. 

**Provenance File:**
> Provenance ... file identifies the build platform itself (usually a hosted CI/CD platform, such as GitHub Actions or Google Cloud Build) and the configuration parameters used to generate the final build artefact.

**Build Levels:**
> Level 1 compliance provides visibility into the build process so that honest mistakes can be caught: the provenance file need only include the data described above and be published in an accessible location. 
>
   Level 2 ensures the authenticity of the build provenance file. The key requirements are that the provenance file must be signed by the build platform, and the build must be run on dedicated infrastructure. 
>  
> At Level 3, additional build platform hardening prevents forgery of the provenance file. The build platform must prevent user-defined steps in the build process from accessing the signing key, and no two builds should be able to influence each other in any way, whether they run in series or in parallel.

*We suggest prioritizing your SLSA verification work as follows.*
>
> 1. **Start by configuring verification for container images.** In practice, container image dependencies do not explode in number as quickly as software package dependencies, so verifying container dependencies can generate a lot of value quickly.
> 2. **Implement a SLSA checklist that must be completed for each new dependency distributed to your build system in a binary, container image, or other pre-built artifact.** If the dependency publishes signed provenance, automate the process of obtaining and verifying the provenance file. Make sure that your build fails whenever provenance verification fails!
> 3. **Initiate a long-term workstream to add provenance verification to all existing dependencies.** For projects with lots of dependencies, this step will take the most work. Set realistic target dates and work through your backlog at a reasonable pace.
> 4. **Request SLSA provenance from your upstream vendors who do not already publish it.** Make some noise about SLSA (politely, that is)! Let your partners know you are focused on supply chain security and are looking for providers who are too. If you have the resources, consider submitting your own pull requests to add SLSA compliance to your most critical dependencies.
