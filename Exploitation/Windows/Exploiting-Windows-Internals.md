# Exploiting Windows Internals

Windows internals are core to how the Windows operating system functions and can be used to hide and execute code, evade detections, and chain with other techniques or exploits. The term Windows internals can encapsulate any component found on the back-end of the Windows operating system. This can include processes ([[Windows-Processes]], file formats, COM (**C**omponent **O**bject **M**odel), task scheduling, I/O System, etc. This article focuses on the abusing and exploiting processes and their components, DLLs ([[Dynamic-Link-Libraries]]), and the PE (Portable Executable, see [[Windows-PortableExecFormat]]) format.

## Abusing Processes

Process injection is commonly used as an overarching term to describe injecting malicious code into a process through legitimate functionality or components, consider reviewing [[Windows-Processes]] article description related to Windows Process. For regular [[Windows-Shellcode-Injection]] enjoy the article.
