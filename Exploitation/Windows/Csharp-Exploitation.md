# C\# Exploitation


## Deserialization Attacks

Firstly, from [Tiago Araújo's medium blog](https://medium.com/c-sharp-progarmming/stop-insecure-deserialization-with-c-6a488c95cf2f): - *"Serialization is the process of saving an object’s state as a sequence of bytes... - Deserialization is the process of restore the serialized data."*

Deserialization [it is out moded form of coding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide), that developers still use regardless of safety. [Vbscrub](https://vbscrub.com/2020/02/05/net-deserialization-exploits-explained/): *"The first thing to note about this whole process is that essentially **serialization is just a fancy word for converting objects in a program’s memory into another format that is easier to share or send over the network**. These “serialized” formats are usually quite easy for humans to read, especially when compared to the raw binary format they are stored as in memory. XML and JSON are common examples of these easy to read serialization formats...Deserialization is, as the name suggests, the opposite process. Converting back from XML/JSON/etc into a .NET object in memory that the program can work with."

- `deserialize()` deprecated functions
- Ill defined Properties - `TypeNameHandling` configuration to `TypeNameHandling.None`
	- Specifying `None` when the program is to expect `None`
 - Not using specific types - generic types such as `object` or `dynamic` are vulnerable 

#### Newtonsoft.Json vulnerability

Newtonsoft.Json uses reflection to construct objects and deserialize a JSON document to a memory object.
