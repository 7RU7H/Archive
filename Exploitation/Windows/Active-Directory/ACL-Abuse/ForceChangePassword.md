# ForceChangePassword

```powershell
$SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '$currentpassword$' -AsPlainText -Force
$Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('$domain\$user', $SecPassword)
```

Then create a secure string object for the password you want to set on the target user:

```powershell
$UserPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Password123!' -AsPlainText -Force
```

Finally, use Set-DomainUserPassword, optionally specifying $Cred if you are not already running a process as current user:

```powershell
Set-DomainUserPassword -Identity $targetUser -AccountPassword $UserPassword -Credential $Cred
```
