# Binary Exploitation Enumeration


File information
```bash
file
```

Strings
```bash
# Search each file specified and print any printable character strings found that are at least four characters long and followed by an unprintable character. 
# Often used to find human-readable content within binary files.
# Different strings encoding may reveal different hardcoded credentials on poor designed applications
strings -e s # 7-bit byte (used for ASCII, ISO 8859) - Default
strings -e S # 8-bit byte
strings -e b # 16-bit bigendian
strings -e l # 16-bit littleendian
```

For some reason you are stuck on windows - without encoders [REF](https://superuser.com/questions/124081/is-there-a-windows-equivalent-of-the-unix-strings-command)
```powershell
more < FILE_PATH.exe | findstr "."
```

## Check for binary protections

`checksec` tool from [[Pwntools]] can examine a binary for anyy binary protections; the output exception and commented detail to each line provided below:
```bash
ARCH	# architecture
RELRO	# Partial = global offset table is r+w
Stack	  # If the stack has canaries to prevent exploitation
NX		    # If enabled, we can't execute custom shell from the stack 
PIE			 # 	If no = NO ASLR, start address is the same.
```

##  ELF Specific

```bash
ldd $binary
# Patched the bianry with only local library (From the host that binary was compiled!)

# Change the DT_RUNPATH of the executable or library to RUNPATH.
patchelf --set-rpath . $binary # Very important!!!
# Change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter") of executable given to INTERPRETER.
patchelf --set-interpreter ld-linux.so.2 $binary
```

[[ELF-Binaries]]
```bash
# Read the entire ELF 
readelf -a 
# Read just the Headers
readelf -h
# Read strings
readelf -x .rodata $FILE
```

## Binary Analysis 

Perform binary analysis with [[angr]]

## Dynamic Analysis

[[GDB]] with either [[GEF]] or [[pwndbg]]
