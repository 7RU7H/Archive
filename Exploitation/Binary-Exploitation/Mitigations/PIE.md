# Position Independent Executable (PIE)


[siphos - High level explanation on some binary executable security](https://blog.siphos.be/2011/07/high-level-explanation-on-some-binary-executable-security/): *"**PIE**, meaning Position Independent Executable. A **No PIE** application tells the loader which virtual address it should use (and keeps its memory layout quite static). Hence, attacks against this application know up-front how the virtual memory for this application is (partially) organized."*
- Disassembly:
	- Will not produce addresses
	- Will produce offsets
