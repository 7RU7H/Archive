# CPU Architecture


## Endianess

Endianess is key to understanding that the most significant bit is located on either side of eight bits. **L**east for memory is **L**eftmost  **Least** significant, fortunately in English no matter the width.
```
LITTLE ENDIAN           0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1  <<THIS SIDE IS MOST IMPORTANT
                        ^LSB       MSB^    


BIG ENDIAN      THIS SIDE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT >> 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
                                                   ^MSB       LSB^
