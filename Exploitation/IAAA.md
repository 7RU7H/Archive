# IAAA


OWASP 2025: consider it as a failure to secure these such that the resulting malicious activity accomplishes these in some order and privilege level.

- **Identity** - the unique account (e.g., user ID/email) that represents a person or service.
- **Authentication** - proving that identity (passwords, OTP, passkeys).
- **Authorisation** - what that identity is allowed to do.
- **Accountability** - recording and alerting on who did what, when, and from where.
