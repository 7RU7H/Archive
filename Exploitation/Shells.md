- Cheatsheet from highoncoffee.
- Generate reverse shells with [revshells](https://www.revshells.com/). 
- Hack-Tools browser plugin also has reverse shell generator for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hack-tools/cmbndhnoonmghfofefkcccljbkdpamhi) and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hacktools/)
