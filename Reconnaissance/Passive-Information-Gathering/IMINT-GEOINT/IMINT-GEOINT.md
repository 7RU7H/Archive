## Finding stuff formula
```
Camera location =  Images Details, webcam name, url pointer -> IP address to geolocate, check ASN number or find it on Shodan. 
```

Recursively dork the image details(Dates, landmarks); Google map you way to look back onto the perspective from where you locate the camera.

## Considerations per location

1. Driving on which side of the road
