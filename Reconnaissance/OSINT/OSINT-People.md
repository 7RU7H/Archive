# OSINT People

This is a TTPs to add to as I continue to learn and improve [[OSINT]]-ing people online and offline. Be aware that recursive questioning is almost certainly required. Similarly to other Question based methodologies in this repository links to tools will be provided only as partial answer that should be accompanied by either another set of questions or explanation, rationale, etc... Tool based methodologies make your brain defective.
