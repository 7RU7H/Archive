# Love Language

##### **Do not be a love Casio**

Scientifically the concept is unproven, yielded mixed or inconclusive results and research mostly refuting it. The reason this page is here is to remind the reader that the reader has not yet passed the confidence threshold of experiencing relationships to know what to do. So with **balance**:
- Words of affirmation
- Gifts
- Touch
- Quality time
- Acts of Service
