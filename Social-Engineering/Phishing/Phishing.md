## Types of Phising

Spam - unsolicited junk emails sent out in bulk to a large number of recipients. The more malicious variant of Spam is known as MalSpam.
Phishing -  emails sent to a target(s) purporting to be from a trusted entity to lure individuals into providing sensitive information. 
Spear phishing - takes phishing a step further by targeting a specific individual(s) or organization seeking sensitive information.

Smishing - takes phishing to mobile devices by targeting mobile users with specially crafted text messages. 
Vishing - is similar to smishing, but instead of using text messages for the social engineering attack, the attacks are based on voice calls.
