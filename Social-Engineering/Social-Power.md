## 48 Laws of Power

48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene is book describing some laws regarding dominance as applied to a variety of domains. A kin to books like the Art of War, The Prince, etc it is controversial due to its blunt take on human active. The author defends it similarly to how Nietzsche attacks Slave Morality. The author of this page has not read this book, but I have listened to Robert Greene explained each law. I think this has with everything else written here in the Repository aided me best given the depth of the contents of books like this. I highly recommend listening to Robert Greene's explain this rather than buy the book, then buy the book out of respect for the Author. I would also like to add seeing as I am printing this here that each law has flexibility not because of authorial cowardice or lack of thoroughness, but due the situational usage of any one law is unique to its setting and participants.
