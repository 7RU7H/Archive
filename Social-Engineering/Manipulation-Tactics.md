# Manipulation Tactics

This is a just tactics listing along with defences and mitigation for the socially inept or too optimistic made from the thumbnails of videos I did not watch.

Key defences
- Be awake - if not awake say you are tired and think about it later
- Observe and listen - everything is about everyone else it is never, never about you: **crucial**  
- Always be diligent, well feed and slept before negotiating - tactical retreating is bread and butter of avoid manipulation - avoid making decisions when you do not control timing  
- [[Remove-Biases]] (except the innate that you cannot)
- Play stupid - adversaries will always check your vulnerability to there behaviours, by observing facial micro-expressions you will observe dopamine excretion they cannot help by smile, very, very quickly. 
- Don't know, Someone else, Somewhere else, Somehow, Not sure - modality (create more work in the adversary have to mentalise (build and reconstruct) and then have evaluate what they have to do to manipulate to get what they want)
- Eventual if strategically possible make them panic and cause self-incrimination and contraindication amongst allies and witnesses.  
- Always increase stress in adversary and lower your stress in least observably active way
- Time, You and work (you doing stuff) are a commodity - NEVER EVER FORGET THAT
	- Value it correctly, treat all manipulation as a balance sheet and apply Buffet and Munger like approach to life - if the number go up over time, because you choose things you understand and think long term; short term manipulators of the socail market place will always pay the price for your accounting dilgence

- Aggression  
	- Description: 
		- Assert dominance thorough threats, violent psychological abuse, physical abuse
	- Why?

- Blackmail  
	- Informational Blackmail
		- Description:
		- Why?
			- Because they want something
		- Defences:
			- Be yourself - [[NOPSEC-101]] - blackmail is operational expensive for a reward, do not do anything worth blackmailed for. Use Red Team thinking about if your worst enemy was to blackmail, could they? If so stop whatever it is because operational liabilities cost.
			- Being a law abiding citizen without corruptibility or secrets make it expensive for an adversary to go to the same lengths to get what they want from you with a different tactic 
	- Emotional Blackmail

Time is expensive always gain more out of it in the short term. Beware long term affects of not saying no or not making it expensive for you favour. Always liquidate favour at time or short after transaction - never bank favours. People will start forgetting things.

But never openly object, just ask questions. Pretend to negotiate in most bureaucratic way possible. Then if they still come back lie or tell the truth about how you insert-verb-here from someone else (deflect matter-of fact and allow for awkward pause till they go); if they still try to persuade you, ask them to come back another day and do the same time from the top all over again.
