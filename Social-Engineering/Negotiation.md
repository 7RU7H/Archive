Chronicity - How we use time; Whoever dominates time controls all battles and all wars.
- Juries are less lenient in the afternoon - why? blood sugar! 

Entropy - through venting
- Attrition of energy spent around a topic you want to dominant at a later point, to ensure the engagement becomes warped towards your objectives

	- How am I supposed to do that? - Forces empathy
	- If countered, you have more clarity
6. Your offer is very generous, but I'm afraid it just doesn't work for me - Removes external criteria
7. Sounds like you have place you like to start (Alternative: Sounds like you got a something you'd like to discuss) - as a response to how are you? (Authorial note: this is a very negotiation setting specific Tip beware this wont work in the  regular day to day)

#### Harvard 4 Elements of Principled Negotiation

From [harvard.edu/ - principled-negotiation-focus-interests-create-value/](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/daily/negotiation-skills-daily/principled-negotiation-focus-interests-create-value/)

Inspired by the Bastard negotiation strategy from: [FortNine How to Rip Off the Dealership - Bastard Negotiating Tactics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fbr3JZAXDxA) 
Preparation:
- How and when participate gets value from the negotiation 
- What timing makes the successful negotiation most likely based on time
- Go to the table know what you want, how much it is going to cost plus an alternatives to bluff with and to settle with if miscalculation that would result in the long term more cost 
At Negotiation:
1. Bluff what is proverbially on the table - exhaust decision making, prop up resolution to then...
2. Then rearrange the table with a swap due to attempting to get preferential deal
