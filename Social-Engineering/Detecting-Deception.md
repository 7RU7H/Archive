# Detecting Deception

Beware of long standing terrible unscientific material regarding this topic as if it is too good to be true it probably is, does it have proof consider: [YouTube Patrick Boyle - History's Greatest Conman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWIqI11wtZ8).

To detect deception we have to remember:
- There is no Pinocchio effect! There is no Paralinguistic features indicative of deception.
- Behaviours indicative of physiology 
- Everybody lies for social cohesion and social survival. 
- Protect yourself from liars by segmenting:
	- What is being said?
	- What is the proof?
- Calming down and providing comfort 
	- Calmer the participant the better the recall - easier to recall that which is trying to be hidden.
	- Will reveal protective behaviours of a potential deceiver trying to protect the truth
		- But meta information and information about the data that is being *potentially* lied about.
		- Meta-information about social interactive aligned with observations  
	- If comfortable the default state is comfort not alertness thereby easier to observe collations between how information is being processed and the Paralinguistic features of the participant
	- Lead and control natural discussion over a length of time to attrition alertness and internal deceptive planning 
	- Induce comfort by relevancy theory to information that is pleasing or comforting 
- Discomfort is not indicative deception - there are lots other reasons for discomfort behaviours
	- The is no scientific evidence that discomfort equals deception
	- Stress reduces recall capabilities
	- Reduces rationality - i.e it can then feel to participant to exclaim or acts irrationally - admit to somethings that are not true to avoid more discomfort
- Cogitative Load as a reaction to answers that probably should be without that load - simple question, difficulty answering as the cognition required to answer goes up because of *something* is 
	- An artefact and not conclusive evidence.
- Creating discomfort is commonly unsuccessful
	- Even if provable prior to causing psychological pressure there is still potential at least somewhere between half an hour to an hour before participant will return to normal state 
	- Violating space increases discomfort
	- Violating linguistic, sociological, anthropological and other maxims increases discomfort
	- Escalation for Joe Narvarro of over 13 thousand interviews has derailed him
- Use a Calming voice, low and slow 
	- This is both authoritative and cede control over discourse pace to you to prevent race-conditions by participant derailing your objectives.
- The effective liars are habitual liars
	- You need information from multiple sources and handling it with care and logic
	- To best them requires separation and segmentation of information stated and surrounding gathered through other methods and the participant
	- The best liars reduce their cognitive load thorough inducing cognitive load in those they are trying to deceive while maintaining misdirection and protection against the truth by conversing fluidly and normally given relevant context(s).
- Make the effort to question and identify lies
