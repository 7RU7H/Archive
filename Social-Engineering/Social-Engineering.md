# Social Engineering


[Robin Dreeke's Mantra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3XR4QrJyxA) to gain another's trust:
- seek their thoughts and opinions
- talk in terms of their priorities
- validate without judging them
- give them choices
... but also who not too trust
Why are they trying to...
- seeking my thoughts and opinions
- talk in terms of my priorities
- validate without judging me
- give me choices

Context is almost everything and paranoia is much worse than diligence.

#### Work in progress

This is just a place to dump ideas and theory before separating out cheatsheets and theory, etc to other pages


Consensus and Social Proof

Urgency 
- Emergency
- Scarcity
- Deadlines

Authority
- Societal social hierarchies (results may vary and the below is a example of hierarchy of authority, which may be prevalent amongst population):
	- Intelligence trumps Army
	- Army trumps Law Enforcement
	- Law Enforcement trumps Civilian
- Honorifics 
	- Rank 
	- Titles
- International standards (abstract legal requirements that have to be observed over some local hierarchy of authority)
	- Diplomatic immunity

Intimidation
- Intimidation at its best when the victim does the most mental effort to:
	- conform to a understandly fear inducing Narratological directionalism (leading someone to a cliff to lets them mentalise the outcomes)
	- easily visualise outcomes use of euphemistic language 
	- understandable, but brief
	- vocal and syntactic control to 

Protections and Mitigation:
- Buy time to think objectively
- Control conversation with faux intimidated body language to interrupt flow of intimidator as if to ask more questions; do not be afraid of appearing the idiot
- Elevate to a line manager
- Request time to think, say you do not understand to buy time to then assess objectively (taking a metaphorical step back)
- Be strong in being weak and control through subtle retention of flow of conversation - a threat is to be communicate, if it not done affectively is some what nullified 
- If it is possible lie to deflect, better bumble (create confusion over what you are, know and how the attacker has to ) 

Ultimately you are trying what you can to remain objective as possible and deflect by elevating to higher authorities

Familiarity and Trust
