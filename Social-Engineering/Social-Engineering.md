#### Robin Dreeke Manta

[Robin Dreeke's Mantra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3XR4QrJyxA) to gain another's trust:
- seek their thoughts and opinions
- talk in terms of their priorities
- validate without judging them
- give them choices
... but also who not too trust
Why are they trying to...
- seeking my thoughts and opinions
- talk in terms of my priorities
- validate without judging me
- give me choices

Context is almost everything and paranoia is much worse than diligence.

#### 4 Laws behaviour childhood

1. Everyone is suffering and insecure
2. .
3. .
4. Everyone = Childhood Suffering \* Childhood Reward
	- How does someone make and maintain friendships?
#### Facial expression reading is essential = just read the lines on their face (and let the back part of your brain handle the recognition)

#### What does the participant want me to feel about them and what do they want me to notice? Everyone is wearing a mask how thick or thin is it?
#### Use their words

#### Everyone is screwed up = understand a person deals with judgement and shame; how do they hide it?

#### The Limbic system is responsible for gut feelings

#### Blink Rate as measurement of stress

#### Bait Question or Elicitation 

Bait Question:
- Is there any reason their was `x <witness testimony, artifact (does not have to be true..)> 

Elicitation - statements bypass frontal cortex protection mechanisms
- `<Greeting>`... `lead in like:` I hear that you employee pays you X amount -
#### Missing words, like pronouns = signal distancing 

#### Find the culprit = *"What do you think the punishment should be?* 

#### Fear speeds up the body; are you fastest enough?
#### Is that true?

#### Sociopaths and Psychopaths vs total calm and have neutral facial expressions = that is what they need

#### Eye Closing

Either:
- Emotional blocking
- False humility 
	- Is there a postural readjustment and facial difference? 

#### Walk them thorough the five stages of grief 

- Grief
- Anger
- Bargaining
- Depression
- Acceptance

#### Manipulators

Tactics
- **F**ear
- **O**bligation
- **G**uilt

Seeking:
- **C**ontrol
- **A**pproval
- **V**alidation
- **A**ttention

#### Columbo

1. Behave faux confused and act stupid, but invite others to help you understand something as method of questioning 
	- compare information to evidence and pervasive facts about the world and systems in it, etc...
	- The other participants will provide you with *their* information that *they* want to provide

#### Phases

- Recon
	- Dumpster Diving
	- [[Search-Engine-Dorking]]
	- [[OSINT]]
	- [[SOCMINT]]
	- [[IMINT-GEOINT]]
	- Cyber [[Active-Recon]] and [[Passive-Recon]]
	- [[Malware]]
		- Screenshoting 
		- [[Keyloggers]]
	- Shoulder Surfing
		- Reading over the shoulder of someone on phone or computer
- Pretexting - Taking on a persona
	- More planning and research equates to more success
		- Objectives
		- Possible paths including failure states to pivot from
		- Is friendly all it takes
	- Shared interests help
	- Acting and Authenticity
	- Keep it simple stupid
	- Use information that does not require verification
- Elicitation - Using persona to extract information
	- People like to appear informed 
	- People like to be appreciate 
	- Most people are honest
	- Mirroring effectively
	- Retain character 
	- Create trust
	- Effective Questioning
		- Neutral question - not directing the answer
		- Open Question - encourages long answers
		- Closed questions - yes or no, good or bad
		- Leading questions - coercing a target answer
- Manipulation - is not influencing, which is change a persons mind for their benefit where manipulation is to do so against the interests of a victim
	- Fear - but provide the relief
	- Guilt 
		- compliance by favour
		- blackmail
	- Foot in the door

Consensus and Social Proof

Urgency 
- Emergency
- Scarcity
- Deadlines

Authority
- Societal social hierarchies (results may vary and the below is a example of hierarchy of authority, which may be prevalent amongst population):
	- Intelligence trumps Army
	- Army trumps Law Enforcement
	- Law Enforcement trumps Civilian
- Honorifics 
	- Rank 
	- Titles
- International standards (abstract legal requirements that have to be observed over some local hierarchy of authority)
	- Diplomatic immunity

Intimidation
- Intimidation at its best when the victim does the most mental effort to:
	- conform to a understanding about fear inducing Narratological directionalism (leading someone to a cliff to lets them mentalisation of the outcomes)
	- easily visualise outcomes use of euphemistic language 
	- understandable, but brief
	- vocal and syntactic control to 
- [Lazy Eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWCH9unC0Wc) for the Critical Hit!


Protections and Mitigation:
- Buy time to think objectively
- Control conversation with faux intimidated body language to interrupt flow of intimidator as if to ask more questions; do not be afraid of appearing the idiot
- Elevate to a line manager
- Request time to think, say you do not understand to buy time to then assess objectively (taking a metaphorical step back)
- Be strong in being weak and control through subtle retention of flow of conversation - a threat is to be communicate, if it not done affectively is some what nullified 
- If it is possible lie to deflect, better bumble (create confusion over what you are, know and how the attacker has to ) 

Ultimately you are trying what you can to remain objective as possible and deflect by elevating to higher authorities

Familiarity and Trust

#### Personal Mitigation 

- Know and train the common target:
	- Junior staff
	- Contractors
	- Administration 
	- Support staff
- Ask for identification 
- Watch for out of character questions
- Do not let the guest roam free in building
- Do not use discarded USBs that are found lying around
- Be aware of what you are saying
- Shred Documents and do not just bin them
- Do not store confidential information on a USB
- Use hard drive encryption
- Be aware who is looking over your shoulder

#### Corporate Mitigation

- Identify information or assets are the most valuable
- Implement information coding (colour coding for scaling the secrecy requirements for documents)
- Start with a template then refine - [https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies)
- Patch systems regularly
- Setup document destroying service
- Never assume your company is too small to be a target
