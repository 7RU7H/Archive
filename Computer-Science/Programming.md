# Programming 


- Program, [Wikipedia Computer Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program): *"is a [sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence "Sequence") or set of instructions in a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") for a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") to [execute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing) "Execution (computing)"). It is one component of [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software "Software"), which also includes [documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_documentation "Software documentation") and other intangible components."*
- Process, [Wikipedia Process (computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)):  *"a **process** is the [instance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science) "Instance (computer science)") of a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") that is being executed by one or many [threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing) "Thread (computing)")."*
	- Program is the executable code related to the process
	- Memory refers to the temporary data storage
	- State refers to a specific context of the program as a result of the executed control flow up to that state.
		- Admitted
		- Interrupt
		- Dispatch
		- Completion
		- Wait
		- Exit
- Thread [Wikipedia Thread (computing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)): *"a **thread** of [execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing) "Execution (computing)") is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a [scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing) "Scheduling (computing)"), which is typically a part of the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system"). In many cases, a thread is a component of a [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing) "Process (computing)")."*
	- Serial - One Process, sequentially queuing of tasks
	- Parallel - One Process, where threads are create to execute tasks in parallel (hopefully) 
- Multithreading [Wikipedia Multithreading (computer architecture)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)): *"is the ability of a [central processing unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit") (CPU) (or a single core in a [multi-core processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor "Multi-core processor")) to provide multiple [threads of execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computer_science) "Thread (computer science)") concurrently, supported by the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system")."*
