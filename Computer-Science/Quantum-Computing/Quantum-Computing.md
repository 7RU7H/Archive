# Quantum Computing


[Wikipedia Quantum Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing) simply states *"A **quantum computer** is a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") that exploits [quantum mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanical "Quantum mechanical") phenomena."* The hardware, to overstate is physical matter, which exhibits properties of both waves and particles. The properties exact state is also reverse recursively affected by the same higher order laws of Quantum mechanics.

1. True Positive
2. False Positive
3. False Negative
4. True Negative
Complex null states and external states that do not directly or indirectly interfere and the inverse.  

Classical computing is a exploitation of simplification of Electro-magnetism binary systems like true or false, on or off, peaks  of a sine wave oscillation, etc. Qubits, is a contraction of Quantum bits and singularly a Qubit.
```c
// Classical Computing
0 | 1

// Quantum Computing
// Superposition
0 | 1 | superpositionOf(1 OR 0) // one or multiple states and somewhere inbetween and interference of collapsing of Shrodinger's cat observation as a result 
```


Multiple states, Qubit relations to other Qubits, change of quantum particles and systems, interaction that 

Probabilistic, but with attempt of trying assign, ascertain or speculate, etc could change the state of one of the part of the Qubit that could then affect other Qubits in connection to it or internal to some boundary of state interaction range. Entanglement then is VERB in Quantum Computing to result in a collapse of process into a single state.

> - **Superposition:**Â Superposition is the state in which a quantum particle or system can represent not just one possibility, but a combination of multiple possibilities.
> - **Entanglement:** Entanglement is the process in which multiple quantum particles become correlated more strongly than regular probability allows.
> - **Decoherence:** Decoherence is the process in which quantum particles and systems can decay, collapse or change, converting into single states measurable by classical physics.
> - **Interference:** Interference is the phenomenon in which entangled quantum states can interact and produce more and less likely probabilities.

Range of states possible?
Correlation due to determinism?

- Superposition is the state in which a quantum particle or system is one or multiple states at the same time and at different times in an alignment
- Entanglement is the process in which multiple quantum particles become correlated due to a deterministic universe.
- Decoherence is the process in which quantum particles and systems can decay, collapse or change, the opposite of Entanglement, but still in relation to due to a deterministic universe
- Interference is the phenomenon in which entangled quantum states can interact and produce states at different points in time, becoming more entangled or affected by decoherence 

Quantum Computing is a kind of instantaneous and ongoing mortgaging of a computation simultaneously as providing the solution at the beginning of its runtime, if a solution is deterministically available within the time-span of computers capabilities.
