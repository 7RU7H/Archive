[PinkDraconian's twos complement explaination](https://github.com/PinkDraconian/InfoSecCheatSheets/tree/master/binary): *"Whenever negative numbers need to be converted to an address, it's probably in the [two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement). We can turn it back by doing `n + pow(2, [32|64])` or `(1<<[32|64]) + n`"*
