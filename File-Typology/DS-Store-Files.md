## DS_Store Files

These files *"is a proprietary Mac/OSX system file that holds attributes/meta-data about the folder it resides in. These often appear in file shares that are accessed over the network by a Mac user; but that's not the only way you can get them. You may have gotten it in an archive (ie: a Zip file perhaps) you picked up someplace, which was originally created on a Mac."* [Source: superuser.questions](https://superuser.com/questions/757593/what-is-ds-store-file-in-windows#757596)
