# Cyberwarfare Considerations

##### Communication

- Comprehensibility - how easy it is to understand and communicate
- Generativity - how easy it create combination of or new communicative memes

Encapsulation of as some form of communication:
- Context 
- Relevancy
- Discourse and Meta-Discourse
- Narrativity
- Cognitive mapping to concepts


#### Deception

Good lies are like a close hash collisions to the truth - FIND THIS QUOTE's AUTHOR
...	- as the truth is hash collision with itself I lie is statement measurable as some degree from the actuality. 

Normality is default


#### Counter Deception

Deception is always stressful, counter deception is stressful - stressing pressure a release from a deceptive actor, but remaining calm will highlight the adversary's stress thereby modelling TTPs, the deceptive actor and their weaknesses.

Therefore to prevent good lies
- Enforce transparency as act of self-actuation and self-existence for the system
	- If there are no secrets there is nothing to steal
	- If there everything is visible then damage or destruction is identifiable and has identifiable cause.
	- If transparency is denied its justification must be transparent only in absolute protection of the system
		- If you only have a few of these then less explaining and trust and agreement in the true of need obfuscation of a few nontransparent objects. 
- Enforce and reward good data collection, handling and analysis
- Encourage popular recursive curiosity to improve, but not police - the manner of questioning is important
- Enforce good mental hygiene
	- Emotions < Logic
	- Belief systems to delusions < Science and Logic
	- The *traumatic* should be quantified to not stress choke points in human infrastructure



#### Subversion - People

Soviet defector [Yuri Bezmenov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Bezmenov)'s [1983 Lecture on Subversion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FElIhOh_KI&pp=ygUVWXVyaSBCZXptZW5vdiBsZWN0dXJl)
You cannot subvert an enemy that does not want to be subverted - to prevent subversion have *"faith"* (authorial note: *faith* < TRUST ) in moral superiority... 

Therefore to prevent subversion by:
- Continuous improvement to defend a morally superiority; a self-justified empirically honest and curious self-persisting, self-healing, self-perpetuating system:
	- Make it easy to succeed in the direction of group objectives
	- Trust-able transparent systems are more popular
		- Innovate to create trust 
		- Defending something your group trusts means good actors protect the reliance as mechanism of reliance
		- Inter-dependability promotes trade of education and ideas to protect against subversion
	- Payout rewards for innovation and success for each individual in real material way 
	- Create and reaffirm cohesive group identity and stability that is as fair as prove-abley possible
		- Reaffirm trust, by innovating against doubt
		- Reduce defection
		- Passively insulate solution processes to *people* problems that will always will occur and require contain to prevent hijacking or injection
	- Never have corruption and root it out at the cost of the adversary where possible
		- Even some animals have sub-concept of fairness within groups
		- Reaffirm trust
	- We are defend ordinary people's data, lively-hoods
	- We defend the safety of conceptual designs of very foundation to prevent subversion 
	- Attrition your adversary by being better and more human in all possible ways 
		- Faced with the raw humanity only psychopaths are only group unaffected 

Always learn from adversaries and others - teach others and by extension your adversaries will always lose as their objective is solely to subvert - teach them their subversion is futile to destroy their moral inferiority

#### Validating Information

True/False (Positives and Negatives) and the Null Space with the example context of validating automated scanning in [[Active-Recon]] for True/False (Positives and Negatives) and @MalwareJake explanation of the Null space 

True Positives - Detected and is vulnerable
True Negatives - Found not to be vulnerable, but detection mechanism enumerated successfully
[False Positives](https://www.cgisecurity.com/questions/falsepositive.shtml) - detected, but not vulnerable
[False Negatives](https://www.cgisecurity.com/questions/falsenegative.shtml) - not detected, but detection mechanism failed

Null Space - 
- What do clues connected together within a hypothesis may indicate theory to be true or false
- Example from @MalwareJake: - Nuking the Log off the Event Logs, but there is still Log on Event and the system has not rebooted or shuck down
	- Find:
		- What is not there, but should be
		- What is there, but should not be
	- Consider how atypical the logic chain of events is a why it may have happened
	- Always collect clues and not opinions - collecting opinion lead nowhere, but clues a pieces of a puzzle leading somewhere
