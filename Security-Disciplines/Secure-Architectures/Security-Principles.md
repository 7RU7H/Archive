- [Principle of Least Privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) - grant only the lowest possible privileges required for tasks or services that a role needs
- [Zero Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_trust_security_model) - remove all implicit trust and have granular authorization across a entire set of vectors 
- [Open Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_security) - Security of a system should not depend on its secrecy 
- [Defense in Depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)) - adding as many layers of defense as possible
