# Privacy 

Good Luck and read and much like anything in security update yourself with [awesome-privacy/Lissy93](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy). It is very good list (and makes my markdown look like caveman's dirty protest in a dark cave) and is most actively maintained. That being also includes, like all the other awesome-privacy lists some options that are provably (various ways) not private, use brain, but contains warnings and caveats to help). 

At 17:00 on day-of-month 1 in every 3rd month check [awesome-privacy/Lissy93](https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy)
```bash
echo "0 17 1 */3 * $USER firefox --new-tab https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy" 
```

Always review each with the principles of [[OPSEC]] and yours or your Organisation's Security Models. This page will only change if the best list for privacy applications changes.
