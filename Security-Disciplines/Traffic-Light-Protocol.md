> TLP is a standardized framework for classifying and sharing sensitive information. It comprises four colors -- Red, Amber, Green, and White -- that determine how it can be distributed further and only to those who need to know.
>  - TLP:RED - Information that's not for disclosure outside of the parties to which it was initially shared without their explicit permission
>  - TLP:AMBER+STRICT - Information that's for limited disclosure and may be shared on a need-to-know basis only to those within an organization
>  - TLP:AMBER - Information that's for limited disclosure and may be shared on a need-to-know basis, either only to those within an organization or its clients
>  - TLP:GREEN - Information that's for limited disclosure and may be shared with peers and partner organizations, but not via publicly accessible channels
>  - TLP:CLEAR - Information that can be shared freely without any restrictions
