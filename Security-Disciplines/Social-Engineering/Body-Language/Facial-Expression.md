# Facial Expression


The face takes primacy - is a behavious consistent with comfort and discomfort:
- Comfort 
	- Behaviour associated: Smiling, Laughing
	- Pupil are slightly wider
	- Full lips
	- Chin out
- Discomfort 
	- Furrowing of the brow
	- Squinting 
	- Tucking down of the chin
	- Chin vibrate
	- Covering eyes

We are always communicating and assessing faces
- Hair - how kept is it?
- Forehead - its smoothness?
- Eyebrow - where are they located?
- Eyes
- Glabella (space between brows and eyes) - compressed?
- Nose - wrinkling is indicative of disgust
- Lips - smiles 

Masks:
- Masks are always unsettling
- Mouth coverings
	- Eyes, Glebella and brows still communicate
- Around the eye coverings
- Redirect assessment to hands, feet, necks and shoulders


Chirality = an asymmetric property in chemistry, although it seems symmetric if folded is in fact not
- These is used by Joe to explain how hard to read faces display emotions, one on each side of the face. Solve by:
	1. Dividing the face 
- Normally we see emotion display on the face fully, if this not the case that is must be focused on because something is not right.
