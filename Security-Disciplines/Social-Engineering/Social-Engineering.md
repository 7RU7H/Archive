[Robin Dreeke's Mantra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3XR4QrJyxA) to gain another's trust:
- seek their thoughts and opinions
- talk in terms of their priorities
- validate without judging them
- give them choices
... but also who not too trust
Why are they trying to...
- seeking my thoughts and opinions
- talk in terms of my priorities
- validate without judging me
- give me choices

Context is almost everything and paranoia is much worse than diligence.
