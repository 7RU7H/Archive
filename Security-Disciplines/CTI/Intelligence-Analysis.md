#### Intelligence Cycle

Agents in these models: Intelligence Community, Customers, Target

Although this is a circular process is also intractable so is not fixed linear stages.

Planning
- For example: Policy Makers -> Intelligence community (What is X?)
Collection
- [[OSINT]], [[HUMINT]], [[GEOINT]], [[IMINT]], etc...
Procession
- Translation, Curation, Database building, Provide context to Source information, etc
Analysis 
- Judgement to provide Intelligence product the communicable to Intelligence customers
Dissemination 
- Briefings, Reporting, curated daily documentation for policy makers
Evaluation 
- Feedback to the parts of the Intelligence cycle

Clark's Target Centric Model

Target -> Analytical answers -> Problems (customer) -> Information Needs
Target -> Analytical gaps and needs -> Information (sources) -> New Information

#### Analytic Standards

- Objective
    - Avoid biases through methodology and techniques, update promptly when warranted
- Independent of Political Consideration 
- Timely
- Complete
- Based on all available source of intelligence information and identifying gaps
- Implements and Exhibits Analytic Tradecraft Standards
    1. Properly describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data and methodologies
    2. Properly expresses and explains uncertainties associated with major analytic judgements  
        - Conform to rubric of standardised language around measurements of probability about both uncertianity of forecasting of outcomes and uncertainty of your own assessment that compromise Analytic products
    3. Properly distinguishes between underlying intelligence information and analyst's assumptions and judgements
    4. Incorporates analysis of alternatives
    5. Demonstrates customer relevance and addresses implications
    6. Use clear and logical argumentation
    7. Explains change to or consistency of analytic judgements 
    8. Makes accurate judgements and assessments
    9. Incorporates effective visual information where appropriate
 
#### Critical Thinking 

The playlist references David T. Moore Critical Thinking and Intelligence Analysis

Definitions: 
- Thinking (or reasoning): involves objectively connecting present beliefs with evidence in order to believe something else.
- Critical Thinking is a deliberate meta-cognitive and cognitive act whereby a person reflects on the quality of the reasoning process simultaneously while reasoning to a conclusion.

Modes of Reasoning
- Deductive Reasoning - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning) *"is the process of drawing valid [inferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference "Inference"). An inference is [valid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(logic) "Validity (logic)") if its conclusion follows logically from its [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise "Premise"), meaning that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false."*;
- Inductive Reasoning - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning) - **Not** *"[mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction "Mathematical induction"), which is actually a form of deductive* reasoning and is actually *"is any of various [methods of reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_reasoning "Method of reasoning") in which broad generalizations or [principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle "Principle") are derived from a body of observations.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning#cite_note-1)"*
- Abductive Reasoning - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning) *"is a form of logical inference that seeks the simplest and most likely conclusion from a set of observations. It was formulated and advanced by American philosopher and logician Charles Sanders Peirce beginning in the latter half of the 19th century."* The issue with this mode being that the complexity of potentially true truth value equations is known to be not always the simplest and mostly likely conclusion. Whereas Deductive and Inductive reasoning are more sound, but not entirely comprehensive to encapsulating the truth of whatever situation is being analysed.

Standards of Critical Thinking as a set spectrums called the Continuum of Intellectual Standards:
`Vague <---> Clear ` 
`Inaccurate <---> Accurate`
`Imprecise <---> Precise`
`Irrelevant <---> Relevant`
`Shallow <---> Deep`
`Narrow <---> Broad`
`Illogical <---> Logical`
`Trivial <---> Significant`
`Unfair <---> Fair`

#### Countering Bias with Structured Analytic Techniques

[YouTube Brian Urlacher - The Intelligence Analysis Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udae1Tz0IcU&list=PLxzz0tls2X9DEgbqzcerj1kBXbWpDT4w_) notes that their video on Countering Bias with SATs references the following `REF: Randolph H. Pherson and Mary C. Boardman. 2017 "Cognitive Biases and Intuitive Traps Most Often Encountered by Analysts: Which Structured Analytic Techniques Best Mitigate Their Impact?"`

Some biases..
- Confirmation Bias: Seeking only that information that is consistent with initial judgements 
- Anchoring Effect: Accepting a given value of something unknown as a proper starting point (Novel schemas are strongest neurological connections)
- Desire for coherence and uncertainty reduction: Seeing patterns in random events 
- Satisficing: Selecting the first answer that appears "good enough"
- Mental Shotgun: Providing quick and easy answers to difficult questions
- Vividness Bias: People tend to overweight the rare but vivid outcomes 
- Availability Heuristic: Favouring information and interpretations that more easily come to mind
- Mirror Imaging: Assuming that other act or think as you would 
- Groupthink: A group dynamic that inhibits reality testing, risk assessment, and moral considerations
- Overconfidence Bias: A collection of biases fostering a belief that we understand complexity and have control over events
- Premature Closure:  Stop seeking out new information or continuing an analysis when answer to a question has been found.

Methods to counter the above:
- Key Assumptions check - record Analysts assumptions
- Starbusting - brainstorming around questions
- Argument Mapping - Diagram the evidence for or against an argument to identify the logic and gaps in an argument 
- Analysis of Competing Hypotheses - an Analyst identifies Mutually Exclusive and Comprehensively Exhaustive Hypotheses and considers the degree to which evidence is consistent or inconsistent with the various hypotheses.
- Quadrant Crunching: A structured counter factual method in which an analyst assumes the converse of key assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of an analysis to assumptions
- Indicator Generation and Validation: Analysts identify, track and regularly re-evaluate observable indicators of change
- Pre-mortem: Analysts assume the counter factual that an analysis was wrong and develop an explanation for why the analysis broke down
