#### Intelligence Cycle

Agents in these models: Intelligence Community, Customers, Target

Althought this is a circular process is also interactable so is not fixed linear stages.

Planning
- For example: Policy Makers -> Intelligence community (What is X?)
Collection
- OSINT, HUMINT, GEOINT, IMINT, etc...
Procession
- Translation, Curation, Database building, Provide context to Source information, etc
Analysis 
- Judgement to provide Intelligence product the communicatable to Intelligence customers
Dissemanation 
- Briefings, Reporting, curated daily documentation for policy makers
Evaluation 
- Feedback to the parts of the Intelligence cycle

Clark's Target Centric Model

Target -> Analytical answers -> Problems (customer) -> Information Needs
Target -> Analytical gaps and needs -> Information (sources) -> New Information

#### Analytic Standards

- Objective
    - Avoid biases through methodology and techniques, update promptly when warranted
- Independent of Political Consideration 
- Timely
- Complete
- Based on all available source of intelligence information and identifying gaps
- Implements and Exhibits Analytic Tradecraft Standards
    1. Properly describes quality and credibility of underlying sources, data and methologies
    2. Properly expresses and explains uncertainties associated with major analytic judgments  
        - Conform to rubic of standardised language around measurements of probability about both uncertianity of forecasting of outcomes and uncertianity of your own assessement that compromise Analytic products
    3. Properly distinguishes between underlying intelligence information and analyst's assumptions and judgements
    4. Incorporates analysis of alternatives
    5. Demonstrates customer relevance and addresses implications
    6. Use clear and logical argumentation
    7. Explains change to or consistency of analytic judgments 
    8. Makes accurate judgments and assessments
    9. Incorporates effective visual information where appropriate
 
#### Critical Thinking 

The playlist references David T. Moore Critical Thinking and Intelligence Analysis

Definitions: 
- Thinking (or reasoning): involves objectively connecting present beliefs with evidence in order to believe something else.
- Critical Thinking is a deliberate meta-cognitive and cognitive act whereby a person reflects on the quality of the reasoning process simultaneously while reasoning to a conclusion.

Modes of Reasoning
- Deductive Reasoning - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning) *"is the process of drawing valid [inferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference "Inference"). An inference is [valid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validity_(logic) "Validity (logic)") if its conclusion follows logically from its [premises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premise "Premise"), meaning that it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false."*;
- Inductive Reasoning - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning) - **Not** *"[mathematical induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction "Mathematical induction"), which is actually a form of deductive* reasoning and is actually *"is any of various [methods of reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_reasoning "Method of reasoning") in which broad generalizations or [principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle "Principle") are derived from a body of observations.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning#cite_note-1)"*
- Abductive Reasoning - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning) *"is a form of logical inference that seeks the simplest and most likely conclusion from a set of observations. It was formulated and advanced by American philosopher and logician Charles Sanders Peirce beginning in the latter half of the 19th century."* The issue with this mode being that the complexity of potentially true truth value equations is known to be not always the simplest and mostly likely conclusion. Whereas Deductive and Inductive reasoning are more sound, but not entirely comprehensive to encapsulating the truth of whatever situation is being analysed.

Stardards of Critical Thinking as a set spectrums called the Continuum of Intellectual Standards:
`Vague <---> Clear ` 
`Inaccurate <---> Accurate`
`Imprecise <---> Precise`
`Irrelevant <---> Relevant`
`Shallow <---> Deep`
`Narrow <---> Broad`
`Illogical <---> Logical`
`Trivial <---> Significant`
`Unfair <---> Fair`
