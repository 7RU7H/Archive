# Tactical Detection

- [[MITRE-ATT&CK]] and [[MITRE-ATT&CK-Navigator]]
- Unique IOCs of previous intrusions are good examples of Threat Intel as theyâ€™re traces of the specific adversary that your environment has already faced.
- Use [[Sigma]] and aided with [Uncoder](https://uncoder.io/) to translate rules on the fly for various [[SIEM-Solutions]], [[EDR]], etc
- Test and tune!
