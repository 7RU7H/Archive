Good Blue Teams are tough to beat
No local admin for Devs
- Can turn off
Restrict access to the `C:\` to normal users
- especially if you are backing up "Protected Files" ala FTK: Hives, SAM, SECURITY files
Domain Admin is stage 0 for psychopathy:
- exfiltrate ntds.dit and crack offline
- prove sensitive data access
- prove privilege access

Team in the background does all the noise stuff and the special stuff
- Spraying
- Keberoasting for Silver, Diamond and Sapphire tickets
- Pop head of 
- 
- Blue Team and delete logs off the dashboard

Emulate Insider Threat:
- If you have good privileges from a offensive stand point remember the service of being locally meticulous over every applications - 8 weeks is a long time
- Ramp up to louder noise over time
- Behave like a disgruntled employee not the North Koreans: [KnowBe4 - Seytonic Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd9pmPrpFtM)

Moral of the story is if you hit a three letter agency, DO NOT TOUCH THE DOCUMENTS.

Cutoff for anti fraud in Middle East is pretty large compared to the West. Monzo card test account was created (due 999,999 test account transfer hardcoded limit) and test transfer then million dollars and then billion dollar (Monzo phones couple of time). But then a year later HMRC comes knocking... long story short they had rewrite the entire bank system given the lack of validation on whether you had what you claimed in your account and fraud detection
