# Fabric

[Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric) *"is an open-source frame work for augmenting humans using AI. It provides a modular framework for solving specific problems using a crowdsourced set of AI prompts that can be used anywhere."*

  
Note
> May 23, 2024 â€” We will be switching Fabric to Go in a few weeks to avoid all the installation issues with Python. The Go version will be dead-simple to install and will be even faster. Plus easier to update. We already have it working thanks to the heroic efforts of @xssdoctor, and we're just working on testing now! Stay tuned for more info on the release date!
