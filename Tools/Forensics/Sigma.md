[Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) *"Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format is very flexible, easy to write and applicable to any type of log file. The main purpose of this project is to provide a structured form in which researchers or analysts can describe their once developed detection methods and make them shareable with others...Sigma is for log files what [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) is for network traffic and [YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) is for files."*

Both [[Snort]] and [[Yara]] are also present in th Archive.

- Create detection methods and signature alongside IOCs and Yara rules
- Write [[SIEM-Solutions]] search that avoid vendor lock-in
- Share signatures
- Write Custom Detection rules


`Sigma Format` for genric signature descriptions -> `Sigma Converter` applies predefined and custom field mapping -> To third parties like [[Tools/Splunk]] search, [[Elastic]] search queries and other [[SIEM-Solutions]] queries.

Sigma allows for standardization format to share analysis, IOCs, [[Yara]] rules, which may not be avaliable from the in-house collected data.

## Sigma Rule Syntax

[Status types](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber4#):
-   _Stable_: The rule may be used in production environments and dashboards.
-   _Test_: Trials are being done to the rule and could require fine-tuning.
-   _Experimental_: The rule is very generic and is being tested. It could lead to false results, be noisy, and identify exciting events.
-   _Deprecated_: The rule has been replaced and would no longer yield accurate results.Â 
-   _Unsupported_: The rule is not usable in its current state (unique correlation log, homemade fields).

## Tooling

[Sigmac is deprecated to be replace by pySigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/blob/master/tools/README.md)
[pySigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma) - more stable python library than Sigmac

[Unicoder.io](https://uncoder.io/) - is an open-source web Sigma converter for numerous SIEM and EDR platforms.
