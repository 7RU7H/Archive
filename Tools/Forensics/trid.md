# `trid`


`trid` is a file identification tool - [GitHub](https://github.com/dubfr33/trid): *"TrID is a utility designed to identify file types from their binary signatures. While there are similar utilities with hard coded rules, TriID has no such rules. Instead, it is extensible and can be trained to recognize new formats in a fast and automatic way. TrID uses a database of definitions which describe recurring patterns
for supported file types."
