[explainshell.com](https://explainshell.com/) *"This site contains 29761 parsed manpages from sections 1 and 8 found in [Ubuntu's manpage repository](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/). A lot of heuristics were used to extract the arguments of each program, and there are errors here and there, especially in manpages that have a non-standard layout. It is written in Python and uses [bashlex](https://github.com/idank/bashlex), a bit of NLTK (to find the interesting parts of the manpage), a little d3.js (for the connecting lines graphic) and Flask. It is served with uwsgi and nginx. Source code is available [on github](https://github.com/idank/explainshell).*"
