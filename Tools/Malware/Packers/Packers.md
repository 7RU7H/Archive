# Packers

[THM](https://tryhackme.com/room/antireverseengineering): *"Packers are tools that compress and encrypt executable files. It compresses the target executable and embeds it within a new executable file that serves as a wrapper or container" 

- Reduces the size 
- Code obfuscation
- Runtime packing
- Anti-Debugging and Reversing techniques

Generally a packer ultimate needs to be able to reverse the packing with a unpacking function, but also pack the program such that it is obfuscated. Therefore *generally* the process of packed application gets executed:
1. The unpacker gets executed first, as it is the executable's entry point.
2. The unpacker reads the packed application's code.
3. The unpacker will write the original unpacked code somewhere in memory and direct the execution flow of the application to it.
