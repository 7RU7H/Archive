# SIEM-Solutions 

[Security Information and Event Management system or SIEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management) is tool that centralises data of Security Information and Security Events across a network then perform real-time analysis of the security alerts generated by end-points. The term and the initialism SIEM was coined by [Mark Nicolett and Amrit Williams of Gartner in 2005](https://www.gartner.com/doc/480703/improve-it-security-vulnerability-management). SIEM solutions are used to provide correlation on the collected data to detect threats. SOC Analysts utilize SIEM solutions by monitoring and investigating, identifying any false positives, tuning Rules which are causing the noise or more false positives. Then provide reporting and handle compliance while trying to identify blind spots in the network visibility and covering them.

1. Collect data from sources, both Network-Centric and Host-Centric, with Real-time log Ingestion
2. Aggregates Data - allowing for investigation past incidents - improve detection signatures
	- Data Insights and visualization
1. Discover and detects threats through early detection 
2. Identifying breaches and investigate alerts

## Log Ingestion

Windows `Event Viewer` and [[Windows-Events-To-Monitor]] and for Linux .log file from [[Linux/Linux-Concepts/Linux-Logging]]

Some common methods used by these SIEM solutions are explained below:  

1) Agent / Forwarder: These SIEM solutions provide a lightweight tool called an agent (forwarder by Splunk) that gets installed in the Endpoint. It is configured to capture all the important logs and send them to the SIEM server.  

2) Syslog: Syslog is a widely used protocol to collect data from various systems like web servers, databases, etc.

3) Manual Upload: Some SIEM solutions, like Splunk, ELK, etc., allow users to ingest offline data for quick analysis. Once the data is ingested, it is normalized and made available for analysis.

4) Port-Forwarding: SIEM solutions can also be configured to listen on a certain port, and then the endpoints forward the data to the SIEM instance on the listening port.
