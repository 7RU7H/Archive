# Cyberchef

Itâ€™s the Cyber Swiss Army Knife.

[Cyberchef](https://cyberchef.org/) is *"simple, intuitive web app for analysing and decoding data without having to deal with complex tools or programming languages. CyberChef encourages both technical and non-technical people to explore data formats, encryption and compression....*
...*The interface is designed with simplicity at its heart. Complex techniques are now as trivial as drag-and-drop. Simple functions can be combined to build up a "recipe", potentially resulting in complex analysis, which can be shared with other users and used with their input."*
