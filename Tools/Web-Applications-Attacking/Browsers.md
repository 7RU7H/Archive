# Browsers

Much like the Vim/Emacs or the X vs Y Programming Language and or Paradigm, internet discourse containing the inflated meme usage of the word *war* also continues in the domain of which browser someone uses. Although more statistical decisive per time period, which browser you use depends really on your preferences. The page is just here to mostly because I just found [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/ciu/about) that compares and provides up-to-date browser support tables for support of front-end web technologies on desktop and mobile web browsers. It will never be because I have favourite. I remember a time where `bing` was considered a joke and now with the year of writing being early 2024 - the universe would just be that humbling that `bing` like time has made fools of us all - for time being. I await AI to read  emails and reports to make me better at living with services that are just not digestible to humans.
