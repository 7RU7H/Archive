If you are fortunate or really need Burp Pro, this article may eventual fill up with information about it. I think that it is best to be more open to entry into the knowledge of how something works or tools to understand that and therefore the cheatsheet version surround information about Burp is Community Version Only. See [[BurpSuite]], I suggest for Pro equivalent kindly check the Port Swigger Documentation.
