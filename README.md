## Overview 

Hacking Methodology and Mechanical/Informational/Computational Art, Cheatsheats, Conceptual-Breakdowns. 

The Internet is an awesome resource, but sometimes it is forgotten the power of small, focused and contained networks of information.

## History and Manifesto

The idea came from partially from [Motasem Hamdan](https://www.youtube.com/c/MotasemHamdaninfosec) and my own text based notes starting to get unmanagable. Although this is not [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/) I want my own resource for personal use while also being much more than other especially in terms of curation and long term ownership. Secondly Obsidian "second brains", seem like a good idea so I upload it here to somewhat finalise and prompt me to condense all previous my notes into a better format as my more powerful discourse. Visually mindmapping concepts and intent to metacognitively play with the information are very important in understanding and learning. I also want a long term Open-Source pedagogical archive to last ten thousand years of people still thinking that ownership of information is an acceptable practice regarding the human endeavour and enterprise. **I do not commend capitalism or those sell their work**. If one day people can learn things by downloading it into bionic implants, why shouldn't everyone have access to this resource? Or should any insitution have control some informational resources, which never actually in scope of control OR benefial to there long term objectives - Cyberwarfare will be the biggest wake up call in this decade.

Knowledge and the Truth, will not and should not bow to any authority or any  antithesis.  Authority is emergent and mutable. Truth is immutable and omnipresent. The Universe is detirministic. Please breath and learn to cope.

## On Catergorisation

Im writing out the below to sort of try to justify \*team-\*\[insert-topic-here\]. I reveal more to myself the design of catergorisation of this repository. I do not want to marshall this information into color segments. I almost tried to, but I think that I will segment by topic as a file get to a certain informational content size or reaches beyond its scope. I will keep the text below as more of a person manifesto of constructing this repository:

Regarding catergorising by the Americanism of team coloration I refer to the Leonardo da Vici:*"Learn how to see. Realise everything is connects to everything else"*. I postulate that much of this discuss is caused by the human working community needing to caterogise everything neatly and instituation environments organising people and work. Futhermore I add the more *tao* way of thinking is that Wireshark is not just a defensive tool, as shield can be used to offensively beat metaphorically a metaphor into some poor individual's brain reading this. Intention with any tool alters the common purpose of use. 

The only reason this maybe structured like this is to transition to a better caterogisational model regarding information density and quantity on some topics. I want minium directory tree depth, easy to find and easy to read instructions; I do not want a myriad of treasures that are all too distracting to functional be presented to help fit the purpose of this repository.

So TL;DR: Everything is connected in use, \*teaming is not political statement of how I like organisations or teams or MORE IMPORTANTLY how ANYONE should think about any aspect of cybersecurity or hacking.
