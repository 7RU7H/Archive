## Overview 

Hacking Methodology and Mechanical/Informational/Computational Art, Cheatsheats, Conceptual-Breakdowns. 

Very open to feedback and criticism. Hopeful in the future once I have made a rest API to simple applications I will make public, open source contribution version that would include addition functionality to the API to merge and archive comparative versioning to allow individual to build there own out of information the added or learnt rather than just a big wikipedia of stuff that is there that allows you to track and make the connections for yourself. This is due to my person educational experience just making this.

## Contents

For full links to all Articles alphabetically see [[Contents]] to `./mkContents.sh` can be used to make this file. I have tested it with graph view, but have personally settled for not having it currently, but is there if anyone ever needs it - I decided the Graph looks better, but the script remains for others if required.

## Introduction

The Internet is an awesome resource, but sometimes what it is forgotten the power of small, focused and contained networks of information. This is demonstrative proof of [[NOPSEC-101]]. 

Fundementally set out in memory of [Dan Kaminsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Kaminsky) and the like, to support Ethical Use of all knowledge, models, tools and techniques. White Hats should be like [Witchers of the Information Age](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Witcher_Wiki) - protect and serve, but collaborate, discover, invent and archive.

1. Promote: 
	1. Science and the scientific method
	2. Fixing and break things to fix everything to make it safer
	3. Historic collection, maintaining of the old
		1. Wikipedia, Waybackmachine
	4. Novel and inventiveness 
	5. Free debate and communal health to debate
	6. Fair credit for work done; references and payment - coin for your bug bounty hunters
	7. Optimisation - [[How-To-Be-A-Better-PenTester]]
	8. Raise others up, if you beat them down, raise them yourself - provide the better way. Expand or Die
	10. Diligence - Cleanup, keep systems operational till replacement- Do not crash the box
	11. Collaberation and helping others
1. Denounce:
	- Malicious and Unethical usage of any information contained here
	- Ideology, replace it and any with it with the stategy and task of being a system, improving and maintaining all systems. 
	- Fraud, false information come correct or get corrected, if you are not healthy enough be corrected
	- Discourse that aids in dichotomy wars - Vim vs Emacs, but acknowledge pros and cons
	- Racism 
1. Prioritize:
	 1. (Cheat/Help)sheets for Free and Open Source Software and Free Versions of Tools
	 2. Rules are not just to be broken, a machine can improve its effectiveness through brute forcing probelm solving staticistical 
	 3. Educate to better others and maintain supriority over adversarial concepts to humanity and competing movements of informational control - stupidity, selfishness, stagnation.
	 4. Simplify, but document complexity in a linked context
1. Acknowledge:
	1. Information should be free to those that seek it, but there is prices to uses and seeking of said knowledge.
	2. Educate should be free to free humanity from ignorance and weakness
	3. The past.
	4. Any *"other-side"* - Assimilate or Die.
	5. Break and securing; discovery and proof-checking are infinite processes.
	6. When this repository and users are wrong 
	7. Everyone starts off in utero as a arsehole. Grow, let grow and acknowledge positive growth.
	8. Acknowledge personal preferences, but in so acknowledge the large context is prioritized - all wares are just some racket for some company or persons, you are just a mechanism for market domination.

The idea came from partially from [Motasem Hamdan](https://www.youtube.com/c/MotasemHamdaninfosec) and my own text based notes starting to get unmanagable. Although this is not [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/) I want my own resource for personal use while also being much more than other especially in terms of curation and long term ownership. Secondly Obsidian "second brains", seem like a good idea so I upload it here to somewhat finalise and prompt me to condense all previous my notes into a better format as my more powerful discourse. Visually mindmapping concepts and intent to metacognitively play with the information are vuld like to make a more public and open source, which is important in understanding and learning. I also want a long term Open-Source pedagogical archive to last ten thousand years of people still thinking that ownership of information is an acceptable practice regarding the human endeavour and enterprise. **I do not commend capitalism or those sell that their work**. If one day people can learn things by downloading it into bionic implants, why shouldn't everyone have access to this resource? Or should any insitution have control some informational resources, which never actually in scope of control OR benefial to there long term objectives - Cyberwarfare will be the biggest wake up call in this decade.

Knowledge and the Truth, will not and should not bow to any authority or any antithesis. Authority is emergent and mutable. Truth is immutable and omnipresent. The Universe is detirministic. Please breath and learn to cope. Therefore, as I laugh re-reading this (months later after updating the README for the first time): I recognise that the information in this repository will hopeful be the most accurate. I have yet to and may not ever be an authoritative voice on any or most of the topics in contain here. Falsity is cancer plaguing humanity even with all the resources and models, the Truth should not be out of reach it. It may hurt though. Like for postulation that randomness or non-detirministic potential unviersally that is not the case and logical provable: 

For the past as known informational object as data a structure, time itself being constant to which that data is located, the future is just the detirministic reflection that the same part of all time past is constant unchangable section of time. Some of everything make brutally most unknownable sense, existial dread is just the idleness of the biological body with some that needs to do. Please take your mind off the crush brutally of an uncaring and unreasonable universe and your life and enjoy a repository of how things sometimes works, do work, should not work, actually work as I try to learn and note down the potential ever expand list of `X work` 

This proof will be improvable upon as will the this repository. Please submit pull requests. It is very person project, if you have the correct answer I would like that answer.

If it something cool, probably best make a better article, video explaination or a CTF box I probably end up doing it.

## On Catergorisation

Im writing out the below to sort of try to justify \*team-\*\[insert-topic-here\]. I reveal more to myself the design of catergorisation of this repository. I do not want to marshall this information into color segments. I almost tried to, but I think that I will segment by topic as a file get to a certain informational content size or reaches beyond its scope. I will keep the text below as more of a person manifesto of constructing this repository:

Regarding catergorising by the Americanism of team coloration I refer to the Leonardo da Vici:*"Learn how to see. Realise everything is connects to everything else"*. I postulate that much of this discuss is caused by the human working community needing to caterogise everything neatly and instituation environments organising people and work. Futhermore I add the more *tao* way of thinking is that Wireshark is not just a defensive tool, as shield can be used to offensively beat metaphorically a metaphor into some poor individual's brain reading this. Intention with any tool alters the common purpose of use. 

The only reason this maybe structured like this is to transition to a better caterogisational model regarding information density and quantity on some topics. I want minium directory tree depth, easy to find and easy to read instructions; I do not want a myriad of treasures that are all too distracting to functional be presented to help fit the purpose of this repository.

So TL;DR: Everything is connected in use, \*teaming is not political statement of how I like organisations or teams or MORE IMPORTANTLY how ANYONE should think about any aspect of cybersecurity or hacking. 

## Important AI-related 

With the advent of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) I will be using it because I theorize a kind of [[AI-Whispering]], firstly it is a cool naming and will revolutionize Hacking and [[Search-Engine-Dorking]]. Information gathering is very important and although I think ChatGTP is more of an investment for the future as it is wrong somewhat useless, regardless I write and assimiliate other works with as much credit as I can give in words - references and endorsement. AI will never ruin this. It would ruin the point of this Repo. I use it for what I have or others I trust have verified about the world. I will not use ChatGTP to write anything without editing it and cross referencing it. This is my learning, revision and known best till I assimiliate better  

But. For dramatic variate of an "also".

Information gathering is very important and if an Hacker is able to ask an AI the best phased question it can bridge gaps in understanding of what you are hacking. ChatGPT has its own limitations, but Cheatsheet of Linguistically the best ways to ask questions - [[AI-Whispering]] or AI whsipering is even more valuable, I foresee. 

I write this to state that there will be uses of AI, but the reason I make this is to learn and I here to learn and not either state that I am making some cheatsheet spread and never finish it or be a scam and use ChatGTP to not recognise other humans work - ChatGTP is guilt of that and my biggest criticism - is where did you find this stuff. Its default style is very arrogant. To Summarise:

1. I will sometimes use ChatGTP to add to a cheatsheet to aid humanity in getting the most out of it.
2. Its usage will be to check what it actually recommends and how I can get the most out of it that feeds back to point 1.
3. At some point the more me-esque element of sysntax will fade, but I will not use ChatGTP to write any article as I want to have some of this information in my brain.
4. Luddites never win, but ChatGTP has limits that State sponsered types do not have to deal with - the gap to defend and secure ordinary people's relate cyber assets should not be handed entirely in aftermath.  
5. I need to trust this is the good stuff, using AI to write anything would counter my person goals and information pool. 

## Lots more to come
