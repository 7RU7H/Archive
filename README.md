## Overview 

Hacking Methodology, Cheatsheets, Conceptual Breakdowns - Now with pages that are spellchecked! 

This is a continuous life-long project as the curated answer to the rise of LLMs and its evolution to create something entire human curated and referenced. Any usage of any products on a page-per-page basis will be indicated. If the said product does not provide a reference it won't by default be used. Very open to feedback. All information was obtained from clear-net sites only with references provided.

H.D. Moore: *“If you don’t think you’re a n00b, you’re not trying hard enough.”*

See the [[About]] page for historic dumping of everything that was on this page as well a history of this repository. Among the issues of the author dyslexia is one that is high on the list and although Obsidian introduced a spellchecker in 2023, but it must have be a hard year and half of anyone reading the contents of this repository. Consider [[Alternate-Resources]] page that referenced throughout and support them please!

To disambiguate pages that purely just the notes of talks, videos, lectures, podcasts, etc the file is prepended with the capitalised `TALK-`.

#### For A Contents Page

For full links to all Articles alphabetically see [[Contents]] to `./mkContents.sh` can be used to make this file. I have tested it with graph view, but have personally settled for not having it currently, but is there if anyone ever needs it - I decided the Graph looks better, but the script remains for others if required.

#### For Alternative Resources

For links and description about those resources, which I continuously use and use to validate other resources please consider reviewing the list of [[Alternate-Resources]]. Please be aware that this is on-going effort to add as I can a week to this. I add a description to each as well so if you do not like that email me. If you upset that you are not on that list and you are already referenced somewhere in this repository I will be trying add you as soon as possible.  

#### Neutrality and Authorial Opinions

Due to I am human, I have opinions and will stipulate when something is for clarity is every respect. I am strong proponent of proofs more valuable than opinions. I try to make this project as neutral as possible, but there some issues, concepts, etc I do not want to cover for a number of reasons. To preemptively deal with invalid criticism from strange individual that defend strange individuals or competitors that want clout or individuals, groups or organisations that take some offence to this work or my opinions with unfortunately be memorialised for the digital and temporal eternity they deserve (for absolute branding and legal issues I am stipulating the possibility of a future where the dead are held accountable and judged till whatever eternity it takes for change occurs including paying the future-computation cloud debt of them existing or a digital and physical zoo of those that judge themselves greater than the sum of all future humanity, post-human, etc). Good luck from the luck human in existence and have a great day!
#### AI - LLM generated content

[[Authors-Opinions-LLM]]

Any page containing any content that was aided in someway with AI will specify:
- **Warning `QUANTITY` of this article were created with `< AI Model insert >` and human consultation of `< Relevant Documentation >`**

- **UPDATE 2/2/2024** 
	- I will not any add any more AI assisted content and will attempt to remove it were possible - But leave the Warning in the appendix that page *was once made with AI* 
#### Future 

Hopeful in the future once I have made a rest API to have it be nice and query-able. It will be public, open source contribution version that would include addition functionality to the API to merge and archive comparative versioning to allow individual to build there own out of information the added or learnt rather than just a big Wikipedia of stuff that is there that allows you to track and make the connections for yourself. This is due to my personal educational experience just making this.
