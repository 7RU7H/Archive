# Event Tracing for Windows

[Event tracing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/etw/about-event-tracing) is *"Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is an efficient kernel-level tracing facility that lets you log kernel or application-defined events to a log file. You can consume the events in real time or from a log file and use them to debug an application or to determine where performance issues are occurring in the application."* 

Components on Windows that are part of ETW 
- Controllers - application used to configure event tracing sessions
- Providers - applications that produce event logs
- Consumers - applications subscribe and listen to events in real-time or from a file - like [[Event-Viewer]]

The event information is categorised under these types of levels:
- **Information:** Describes the successful operation of a driver, application or service. 
- **Warning:** Describes an event that may not be a present issue but can cause problems in the future.
- **Error:** Describes a significant problem with a service or application.
- **Success Audit:** Outlines that an audited security access operation was successful.
- **Failure Audit:** Outlines that an audited security access operation failed. 

[Event tracing for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/xperf/event-tracing-for-windows) released with Windows 2000:
- Sessions stored to disk 
- ETL file extension - similiar to EVT/EVTX files
- Found - Common listed below: 
	- `C:\Windows\System32\WDI\LogFiles` - only the last Shutdown and log(on/off)
		- `BootCKCL.etl` - [[Windows-Persistence]] may be indicated here! 
			- `C:\Windows\System32\WDI\LogFiles\BootCKCL.etl`
			- Overwritten each system boot
			- Kernel Events captured during the boot process
				- Processes 
					- Command run
					- Malicious tools
					- Scheduled tasks at boot or logon
				- Threads
				- DiskIO
					- File handling across drives
				- FileIO
				- Image Loading (DLLs, EXEs)
		- `ShutdownCKCL.etl`
			-  `C:\Windows\System32\WDI\LogFiles\ShutdownCKCL.etl`
				- Overwritten each system shitdown
				- Kernel Events captured during the shutdown process
					- Running processes
						- Command run
						- Malicious tools
						- DLLs loaded by a process
					- Running threads
					- Images loaded (DLL, EXEs)
		- `SecondaryLogOn.etl`
		- `WdiContext.etl<###>`
			- Information related to user logon
				- Explorer Startup Executing from Run key
					- `Explorer_ExecutingFromRunKey/Start`
						- Shellbags - folders visited not need to Shellbag explorer
				- Executing from Startup key
	- `C:\Windows\System32\WDI\<GUID>\<GUID>`
		- `snapshot.etl`
	- `C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\WMI`
		- `Wifi.etl`
			- Not fully parsable (2018)
				- WPP events Requiring PDBs and DLLs
			- WiFi network related events
				- WiFi Configuration
					- Network Service Set IDentifiers (SSIDs)
					- MAC addresses
				- AutoConfig information
		- `LwNetLog.etl` 
	- `C:\Windows\System32\SleepStudy`
		- `UserNotPresentSession.etl`
		- `abnormal-shutdown-<data>.elt`
		- `user-not-present-trace-<data>.elt
		- `ScreenOnPowerStudyTraceSession-<data>.elt*`
	- `C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Power Efficiency Diagnostics\`
		- `energy-ntkl.etl`
			- Power diagnostics
				- System configuration
				- Logical drives
				- Physical drives - internal and external
				- NIC
				- Process and Thread
				- Services
- Not all ETL are present on all systems
- Create when..:
	- Windows performance, debugging, troubleshooting
	- Developer debugging
		- Tracing can be enabled at any point for any reason during application runtime
		- Stacks and calls
	- Administrative tasks
		- Manually execute event traces for the system and stored to disk for review
			- Network traffic
- Contains
	- ALOT - [Nicole Ibrahim suggests Microsoft Telemetry data, which is encrypted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUR-L9AtzQE)
		- Header Data
			- Session information
		- Event Data
			- Timestamps
			- Provider and event names
			- Processs and thread ID
			- Level and Task
			- Payload
- ETW Technologies
	- Managed Object Format (MOF)
		- Kernel events 
		- CIM repository
	- Trace Message Format (TMF)
		- Uses PDBs and PE files
	-  Manifest based
		- Uses files formatted as XML 
		- Requires 
			- registration on system
			- resourceFileName and messageFileName from the manifest to prpoperly decode data (Full absolute path)
	- Tracelogging (TL) - introduced in Windows 10
		- Necessary decoding information is embedded into ETL
- Tools - there are limitation decoding/parsing ETLs from other system
	- [[Event-Viewer]] - basic event data
	- Microsoft Message Analyzer
	- Winddow SDK tools
	- ETL Viewer C\# tool written by G-C Partners
	- TraceLogging ETLs not understood pre-Windows 10
