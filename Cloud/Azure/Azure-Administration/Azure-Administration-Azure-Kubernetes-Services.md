# Azure Administration - Azure Kubernetes Services


Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) makes it simple to deploy a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure. AKS service is free and only pay agent nodes within the cluster not the masters; AKS scenarios where you require full container orchestration:
- Service Discovery across multiple containers
- Automatic scaling
- Coordinated application upgrades
Bridge to Kubernetes is an extension in [[Visual-Studio-Code]] and [[VS-Code]] to write, test and debug microservice code on development workstations

Azure manages:
- Kubernetes masters
- Health monitoring
- Maintenance

System Administrator must manage - Agent nodes
