The Azure Virtual WANÂ (wide-area network) networking service combines networking, security, and routing functionalities into a single operational interface. Azure Virtual WAN is a consolidated networking service that provides Network, security and routing functionalities in a single operational interface. Azure Virtuual WAN is a Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) is better way to route to your branches, datacenters, VNet and cloud services.
- Branch Connectivity
- Site-to-site
- Remote User VPN
- Connectivity, private (ExpressRoute) connectivity
- Intra-cloud connectivity (transitive connectivity for virtual networks)
- VPN ExpressRoute inter-connectivity
- Routing
- Azure Firewall encryption for private connectivity

Typology:
-  **Basic**: A Basic Virtual WAN can be implemented only in an S2S VPN connection.
-  **Standard**: A Standard Virtual WAN can be implemented with Azure ExpressRoute and a User VPN (P2S). You can also use a Standard WAN with an S2S VPN, Inter-hub, and VNet-to-VNet connection transiting through the virtual hub.

Terminology:
- A Point of Presence (PoP) is an entry at the edge a Network
- A Hop is when you change networks
- Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) a method of packet forwarding where instead of using IP address and Layer 3 information to make forwarding decisions an MPLS labal is used to determine the shortest route to end destination.
- Software Defined WAN (SD-WAN) decouples CPU intensive tasks from router such as Management, Operations and the Control plane that can now be controlled in a central location remotely and virtually at your headquanters:
	- Replace MLPS, so you traverse the internet insteead of a private network
	- More cost effective require less configuration than an MLPS initially and at scale
	- Secure because you will use HTTPS which is supported by your ISP
