# Azure Administration - Azure Roles and RBAC

#### Azure AD Roles

Azure AD roles are used to manage Azure AD resources in a directory such as:
- Create units
- Edit units
- Assign adminstrative roles to others
- Reset user passwords
- Manage user licenses
- Manage domains
Built-In Azure AD Roles:
- Global Administrator - Full access to everything
- User Administrator - Full access to creat and manage users
- Billing Administrator - Make purchases, maneg subscriptions and support tickets

Governance is about enforcement of rules and ensuring proper functioning to standards. 
- Policies  - WHAT 
- [[Azure-Administration-Azure-Roles-And-RBAC]] - WHO
- Budget - HOW MUCH

Regarding [[Azure-Administration-Microsoft-Entra-ID-Administration]], do not use Classic subcription Roles use either RBAC or [Azure AD Administrator roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference):
![1000](azurerolerbacandadminroles.png)
Azure AD Roles are used to manage resources in Azure AD; Azure RBAC role provide more granular access management for Azure resources.

#### Differentiation 

Azure Policies vs. Azure Roles (RBAC)
Azure Polices | Azure Roles
--- | ---
Ensure compliance of resources | Control access to resources
Does not restrict actions | Manages User actions at different scopes - does restict on Azure Resources

Azure AD Roles vs. Azure Roles (RBAC)
Azure AD Roles | Azure Roles
--- | ---
Controls access of AD resources | Control access to Azure resources

- By default, Azure Roles and Azure AD do not span Azure and Azure AD
- By default, the Global Administrator does not have access to Azure resources
- Global Administrator must be grant access to Azure resource if granted the User Access Administrator role

#### RBAC

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a mechanism that can help you manage who can access your Azure resources. RBAC lets you determine what operations specific users can do on specific resources, and control what areas of a resource each user can access.

Azure RBAC - Organizations using public cloud are concerned about:
1. Ensuring that when people leave the organization, they lose access to resources in the cloud.
2. Striking the right balance between autonomy and central governance

Fundamental Roles of Azure RBAC
![](azurefundamentalrbacroles.png)

Azure RBAC is an allow model; `NotActions` to create a set of not allowed permissions that are then substracted from `Actions` to compute the effective permissions - for example the default [Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) role :
-   Delete roles and role assignments
-   Create roles and role assignments
-   Grant the caller User Access Administrator access at the tenant scope
-   Create or update any blueprint artifacts
-   Delete any blueprint artifacts
`Contributor` is for Admin grant user resource control access.. 

Inheritance Order: `Subscription, Resource group, Management group, Resource`


RBAC core concepts:
![1000](azurerbaccoreconcepts.png)
- `Security Principal` -> `user, group, or application`
- `Role Definitions` -  permissions
- `Scope` - where the permission apply
- `Assignment` -  *"process of binding a role to a security principal at a particular scope for the purpose of granting access"*


[Role for task by Principle of Least Privilege](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/delegate-by-task); TLDR:
- Apps - Application Administrator
- B2C - only Global Admins:
	- Configure B2B external collaboration settings
	- Create B2C applications
	- **Azure AD B2C Global Administrators do not have the same permissions as Azure AD Global Administrators -  make sure you are in the  Azure AD B2C directory!!!**
- Device - Cloud Device Administrator 
- Global Admin is configure control plane settings
	- Required: - exclude combined: BEWARE the combined! i.e Reset guest user invite
		- Manage user settings - Enterprise apps
		- Delete all existing app passwords generated by the selected users - MFA
		- Menage Settings and Terms of Use - Organizational Relationships
		- All but read all configurations and password reset properties - Password resets
		- Configure Authentication methods - Authentication methods
		- Create VPN connectivity certificate - Conditional Access
		- Temporary (except themselves) Configure and manage authentication method policy - Temporary Access pass
	- Not required do X
		- If Provisioning - Hybrid Identity Administrator!
		- Configuring at Y level Contributor
		- Reading - Readers
		- Group - Groups Level Roles
		- If Identity Protect - Security Roles
		- If MFA - Authentication Roles 
		- Privileged Role - Privileged Role Adminstrator
		- Users  - User Admin
		- Support - Service Support Admin plus relevant service 
	- Do not use with 
		- Entitlement
		- Licenses and Billing: relevant
- Important:
	- The only Role containing the term Elevated [Storage File Data Smb Share Elevated Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-file-data-smb-share-elevated-contributor). 
	- Password Administrator != Helpdesk Administrator!
		- On-premise Helpdesk Administrator can perform password resets, which still exist...


## Workflows

Azure RBAC 
```powershell
# List all Azure Roles
Get-AzRoleDefinition | FT Name, Description
# Filter by name and convert to json
Get-AzRoleDefinition <role_name> | ConvertTo-Json
# Get Actions and NotActions Properties, with piped or class dot property
Get-AzRoleDefinition <role_name> | FL Actions, NotActions
(Get-AzRoleDefinition <role_name>).Actions
``` 

Azure RBAC with az role, use [az role definition list](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/role/definition#az-role-definition-list).
```bash
az role definition list
# by name like "Contributor"
az role definition list --name {roleName}
# name and description of all available role definition
az role definition list --output json --query '[].{roleName:roleName, description:description}'
# list all builtin roles
az role definition list --custom-role-only false --output json --query '[].{roleName:roleName, description:description, roleType:roleType}'
# output to json the Contributor Actions, NotActions
az role definition list --name "Contributor" --output json --query '[].{actions:permissions[0].actions, notActions:permissions[0].notActions}'

```

Considerations:
- job role vs resposibitilies, work scenarios - taskes - and miminum requriement necessary 
- Scope of permissions
- Builtin is better most of the time than custom - custom creates security overhead!
- Assignments are also Deny not just allow - a deny assignment attaches a set of deny actions to a user, group, or service principal at a particular scope for the purpose of denying access.


#### Role Creation

Beware - [Azure role definitions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-definitions) - Property names will change whether its: 
- Azure Powershell 
```powershell
Name
Id
IsCustom
Description
Actions []
NotActions []
DataActions []
NotDataActions []
AssignableScopes []
```
or Azure CLI
```csharp
roleName
name
type
description
actions []
notActions []
dataActions []
notDataActions []
assignableScopes []
```
Note use of `/*/`  are wildcards!

List of [built-in role definitions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) -  [custom roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)

[Assign Azure roles using Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-powershell)

Considerations:
- Use [built-in role definitions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) or [custom roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles)
- Limit access scope
- Controlling data modification - apply tight access control for only specific scenarios  
- Applying deny assignments -  a deny assignment attaches a set of deny actions to a user, group, or service principal at a particular scope for the purpose of denying access.

 A custom role definition includes the allowed operations, such as read, write, and delete for Azure resources. The custom role definition also includes the scope of these permissions.

## Role Assignment

Role assignment is for scope access control, which is revokable and inheritable with intent to assign suitable role to requestor. 
-  Security principals supported: user, group, service principal.
- Six built-in roles are implemented, and two custom roles are defined: `Reader Support Tickets` and `Virtual Machine Operator`.
	- Builtin `Contributor` has permissions:
		- `Actions`
		- `NotActions`


## Workflows

Implement management groups 
`Search Management groups -> Management groups`
Setup Azure AD permissions for Implementing Management Groups
`Search Azure ->  Azure Active Directory -> Properties -> Access management for Azure Resources` - Refresh in `Management Groups`
From `Management Groups` - Requires Management group ID and Display name
Create a `Management Group`
`Search Management groups -> Management groups -> <insert Management group ID and Display name> 
Add a management group to a subscription
`Search Management groups -> Management groups -> $Management_group -> Subscriptions`  - Subscription ID is in `Overview`

Custom RBAC role creation:
`Upload a $customRole.json file`  - replace fields reqiure prior to upload!
`Open CloudCLI` to upload
```powershell
New-AzRoleDefinition -InputFile $file
```

Assign roles **at scope** - `Subscription,Resource group, Resource`
`Management Groups -> Access Control (IAM) -> Add -> Search <role keyword> ->  + Select members`
Assign can be done via Resource Group of Admin Scoping in fields
`Resource Groups -> Access Control (IAM) -> Add (role, co-administrator, custom) role -> Search`
`Remove` to remove!
`Activty Log` to find all role (de-)assignments
