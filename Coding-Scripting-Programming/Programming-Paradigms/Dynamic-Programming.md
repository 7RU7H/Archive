Memoization recipes

1. Make work
    - visualise problem as a binery tree
    - implement the tree using recursion
    - test it

2. Efficency concerns
    - add a memo object
    - add base case ro return memo values
    - store return values into memo

Tabulation

- visualise the problem as a table
- size of tablr based on the inputs
- initialise the valies with default values
- seed yhe trivial answer into the table
- iterate through the table
- fill further positions based on the current position

Dynamic programming

- notice any overlapping problem
- decide what is the trivially smallest input
- think recursively to use memoization
- think iteratively to use tabulation
- draw a strategy first visually!
- then code!
