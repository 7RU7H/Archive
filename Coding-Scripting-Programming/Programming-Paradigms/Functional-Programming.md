# Functional Programming

## Good Talks

Given many aspects of functional programming I suggest these talks by Scott Wlaschin are some of the most clear and profound way of thinking about programming and problem solving. Even if you don't want to code in a functional programming language the ideas contained and the manner they are explained in these talks are expectional:
