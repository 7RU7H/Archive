# Web App Race Conditions

[[Web-Applications]] can have race conditions for a number of reasons
Causes:
- Parallel Execution
- Database Operations
- Third-Party Libraries and Services

Multiple Servers, Clients, Networking, Databases, APIs, etc... The Web application complexity can add up very quickly. It also worth consider the systemic context as when attacking web applications for Race Conditions timing is very important and noting the entire architecture, from you to the when the payload is received and processed is important.

State - incoming absolute definitive image I can make not an example
- Branching on state also just because a branch  executes did it actually because of how the RC between an early set(s) of stages

#### [[Burpsuite]]

1. Proxy and capture set of requests and send to repeater
2. Create Group tab `Right Click "+" Symbol` -> `Create Group Tab`, name and add the requests to the group, colour for prevent latter visual clutter. 
3. Duplicate tabs `Right Click <repeater request tab inital name a digit> `-> `Duplicate tab` -> `Duplicate Nth Times`
4. Send group as.. [Send Group Portswigger Documentation](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/repeater/send-group)
	- `Send group in sequence (single connection)`
		- Good for testing [[Client-Side-Desync-Vulnerabilities]].
	- `Send group in sequence (separate connections)`, *establishes a TCP connection, sends a request from the group, and closes the TCP connection before repeating the process for the subsequent request.*
	- `Send group in parallel`
