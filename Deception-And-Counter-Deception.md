Maxim 1 - Magruder’s Principle
It is easier to maintain a pre-existing belief in the target than force a change in beliefs

Maxim 2 - Exploiting Limits of Human and Machine Sensing and Information Processing

Maxim 3 - Jones Dilemma
Deception is difficult if there are more real sources than false sources

Maxim 4 - Carefully Sequence Deception Activities to Tell a Story

Maxim 5 - Carefully Design Planned Placement of Deceptive Material
• Make target “work” for it, don’t boldly announce what you are doing
(example diary easily found on a desk vs. hidden, obfuscated code)
• Contrast this with “orgy of evidence”

Maxim 6a - Ambiguity
Increase doubt by providing many possible truths

Maxim 6b - Misdirection
Decrease doubt by focusing target on a given falsehood

Maxim 7 - Husband Deception Assets
- like a Dragon's Horde

Maxim 8 - Feedback
Includes attackers monitoring for success of deception and monitoring for being deceived themselves.


#### Countering Deception
Four ways to counter deception:
• Intelligence: Directly observing the adversary's
deception planning and activities
• Disruption: Preventing the adversary from
injecting narratives into your sources
• Analytic: Detecting simulated narratives
• Deterrent: Demonstrating detection capability
Developing Analytic Processes:
• Identifying and checking key assumptions
• Devil's Advocacy or TeamA/TeamB
• What do deception maxims imply about defense?

Maxim | Counter-Maxims
--- | --- 
Maxim 1 | Magruder’s PrincipleApply the same critical analysis to facts that support your assumptions that you apply to facts that contradict them.
Maxim 2 | Exploiting Limits of Human and Machine Sensing and Information ProcessingDevelop lots of trustworthy sources of data
and analysis. Measure reality from multiple perspectives and resolutions.
Maxim 3 | Jones Dilemma
Maxim 4 | Carefully Sequence
Deception Activities to Tell a StoryIs there an orgy of evidence? Are facts
being revealed all at once when it would
make more sense for them to emerge
slowly (or vice-versa).
Maxim 5 | Carefully Design Planned
Placement of Deceptive MaterialDon't assume a fact is true just
because it was hard to obtain it.
Maxim 6a | Ambiguity DeceptionIs there more than one narrative present?
Contradictions and incongruities may
suggest deception.
Maxim 6b | Misdirection DeceptionThe Plus-Minus Rule: No imitation can
be perfect without being the real thing. In a
simulation, characteristics will be added or
they will be missing.
Maxim 7 | Husband Deception AssetsModel the adversary's capabilities and
neutralize them.
Maxim 8 | FeedbackBehave as if you believe the deception so the
adversary doesn't pivot. Deter the adversary by showing them that
you've detected the deception. (Pre-bunking)



#### Developing trustworthy sources of data and analysis

• Evaluating independence, expertise, and the biases of
sources of analysis.
• Do you trust this source because of your own biases?
• Evaluating past performance to determine future results.
• Measuring from multiple perspectives and resolutions.
• Triangulating sources of information

- A problem with experts.
	- We can't be experts on everything, but we have to make decisions about things.
We rely on experts to tell us both what the facts are and what to think about them, and that puts us at
their mercy.
- Experts don't have to lie – they can omit and emphasize.


An observation about Journalistic Objectivity.
One Perspective: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
Another Perspective 3 + 5 = 8
• Presenting both of these perspectives doesn't get us closer to the answer.
• The agenda setting power of institutions allows them to influence what
questions are discussed. (See: Steven Lukes)
What if journalistic objectivity was defined as filling in the missing, relevant
pieces of information that other institutions are overlooking?
"Good reporting requires the exercise of the highest of scientific virtues."
- Walter Lippmann
Reality: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5




Four Focus Areas.

Counter-Maxims | Projects
Model the adversary's capabilities and neutralize them. | DISARM Framework Misinformation Village
Measure reality from multiple perspectives and resolutions. | Can we build tools for information
triangulation?
Apply the same critical analysis to facts that support your assumptions that you apply to facts that contradict them. | How do we know when questions have been raised about what we're reading?
Develop lots of trustworthy sources of data and analysis. | How can we identify and collect networks of experts?
