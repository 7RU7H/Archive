# Malware Analysis

## Static Analysis

Using a Disassembler to analyse the suspicious file with executing or partial execution.


## Dynamic Analysis
Excuting the suspicious file and using Analytical tools to observe it interaction with infected system.


## Sandboxes

Sandboxes allow Malware Analysts to perform Dynamic Analysis that is more representive of the actual execution chain of a piece of malware by creating of safe and containize or virtualisd environment for the malware to operate in to then monitor it. Sandboxs within network meaning that any unsafe or suspicious file run simulatively without causing harm before it is run on a production system.'

Types if Sandboxes include Firewalls, Mail Servers and Workstations they are run in paralell by segemented from the actual network. These are replicas of elements of a network that malware targets. For example a Sandbox Mail Server that opens phishing emails containing susupicious links or files or command injection.
