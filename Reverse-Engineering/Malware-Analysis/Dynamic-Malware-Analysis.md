# Dynamic Malware Analysis

Executing the suspicious file and using Analytical tools to observe its interactions with sandboxed  system. See [[Malware-Sandbox]]es. Use a [[Malware-Sandbox]]. Be safe. Probably best practice to have entire dedicated host machine for Malware Analysis. Although [[Hypervisor-Escapes]] exist, why gamble a good machine(s) or hardware. Cost versus Risk is easily solved by spending the money on a dedicated setup. 

- [[Dynamic-Analysis-Evasion]]

[[Sysinternals-ProcMon]]
[[API-Monitor]] or/and [[API-Logger]]
[[Sysinternals-ProcExp]] 
[[Regshot]]

- Check signing of binary
- Check if strings on disk are the same in memory

## Debugging

Given [[Dynamic-Analysis-Evasion]]

Debugger Typology:
- Source-Level Debuggers
- Assembly-Level  Debuggers - no source code no problem, debugs compiled programs at the assembly level allow analysts to observe CPU registers' values in the debugger's memory 
- Kernel-Level Debuggers - lower level than Assembly despite the name, requires two systems:
	1. To debugging the code running on 2.
	2. System to run malware on
