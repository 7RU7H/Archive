# Dynamic Malware Analysis

Executing the suspicious file and using Analytical tools to observe its interactions with sandboxed  system. See [[Malware-Sandbox]]es. Use a [[Malware-Sandbox]]. Be safe. Probably best practice to have entire dedicated host machine for Malware Analysis. Although [[Hypervisor-Escapes]] exist, why gamble a good machine(s) or hardware. Cost versus Risk is easily solved by spending the money on a dedicated setup.

- Check signing of binary
- Check if strings on disk are the same in memory

## Debugging

Given [[Dynamic-Analysis-Evasion]]

- The evasion techniques used to evade basic dynamic analysis.
- Introduction to debuggers and how they can help us control the execution flow of malware.
- Manipulating execution flow at runtime by changing registers or other parameters.
- Patching malware to force it to move past the evasion techniques and onto the actual malicious content.
