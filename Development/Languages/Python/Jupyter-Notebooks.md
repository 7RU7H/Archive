# Jupyter Notebooks



- ***Jupyter Notebook** is a notebook authoring application, under the [Project Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) umbrella. Built on the power of the [computational notebook format](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/#what-is-a-notebook), **Jupyter Notebook** offers fast, interactive new ways to prototype and explain your code, explore and visualize your data, and share your ideas with others.* 
	- *Notebook documents contains the inputs and outputs of a interactive session as well as additional text that accompanies the code but is not meant for execution. In this way, notebook files can serve as a complete computational record of a session, interleaving executable code with explanatory text, mathematics, and rich representations of resulting objects. These documents are internally [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) files and are saved with the `.ipynb` extension. Since JSON is a plain text format, they can be version-controlled and shared with colleagues.* [jupyter-notebook documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html#notebook-documents)
..*The Jupyter notebook combines two components:*
- ***A web application:** A browser-based editing program for interactive authoring of computational notebooks which provides a fast interactive environment for prototyping and explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with others*- ***Computational Notebook documents**: A shareable document that combines computer code, plain language descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, mathematics, graphs and figures, and interactive controls*

Using [[Pandas]] and `matplotlib` 
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


```
