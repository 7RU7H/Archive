# Application Security For The Paranoid


Moloch considers core principles to be Shannon's Maxim:
> "One ought to design systems under the assumption that the enemy will immediately gain full familiarity with them" - Claude Shannon

This entails: we only care about the worst case.

Trusting Trust; TLDR 3 Pages and attempt to reference Professor Brailsford once a year: The Great, Professor Brailsford reflections: [YouTube Reflections on Trusting Trust - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ7lOus1FzQ). White paper: [https://www.cs.cmu.edu Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_ReflectionsonTrustingTrust.pdf); basically make your own language, compiler and securely host your own backup vault on glass for the original with its Transpiler intermediary tooling for irregular changing standards to other languages or rotation of derivative languages that are burnable. **In case this is not an option...**

There is less paranoid ways, otherwise you never make anything. Applications have to be made and testable and provably usable as a viable product of all that labour.

- Rust does its own security problems, it is not magically.
- Productivity is important, if you cannot ship it is not useful
