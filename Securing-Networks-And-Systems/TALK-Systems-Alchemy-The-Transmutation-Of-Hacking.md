*Everywhere we look we find complex systems creating, enabling, controlling and shaping the fabric of modern life. The critical infrastructure of society is dependent on systems, mostly privately owned, that have same the inherent problems of all complex systems. In this keynote we examine the properties of systems and how understanding them creates new opportunities for hacking. Adopting systems thinking allows hackers to target and manipulate everything from critical social infrastructure to the very physics of cyberspace. === Thaddeus Grugq (thegrugq) has been a cybersecurity pioneer for over two decades. His early work created the field of counter forensics. Grugq was actively involved in the information warfare campaign of 2016. More recently he has been managing The Glasshouse Center, a cyber strategy and policy forum examining the nature of cyber conflict. Grugq has been quoted on cybersecurity in The Washington Post, The New York Times, BBC, Vice News, and numerous other news media.*

Rules from this:
1. System only understand their input
	- If the system didn't see it, it didn't happen
	- If it did it did happen
2. Important variable are found by accident - I disagree, but proof exist otherwise 
	- Easy to verify problems after
3. Its systems all the way down
4. Complex System fail in complex ways, because Reality is more complex than it seems.
5. Systems do not adapt to people, we as people adapt to them


Yandex.Taxi - 1/9/2022:
Does this count as System Hacking? No discussion  was that is not Technical no, **BUT it is** the **entirity of Yandex** got hacked

Lead Primitives into effects gold

It is a Sociotechno System:
- Drivers are penalised for cancelling a fare:
	- Awareness
	- Understanding
	- Agency

 Human can detect something is going wrong
- But the system can not

Grupq says this is difficult to predict this as in all computer science theory, but there is Test Driven development..

Systems are only as good as their sensory organs

Cyber Space is all controlled by Private Companies and control the physics of that space:
- Physical infrastructure
- Digital infrastructure

It is controlled by Company Policy; Russia State Propaganda was controlled by Facebook (now Meta) company Policy about how to operate as a by-product of the changes in terms of use. Policy alters the environments, simply Ukraine cutting all Ukraine-Russia Telcos change the environment of the invading forces.

Authorial Notes: 
- Although this example is kind simple and neat here are better examples:
	- Cyber 
		- Shadow Brokers Dumps of NSA tools changed Cyber:
			- Everyone had access to Nation State level tools, IOCs, detection capability to defend against it, confirmation of theories about capabilities regard log exfiltration, pausing and removing specific logs
		- Government Policy
			- As boring as it sounds changes to
				- How international law enforcement and policy by state operates forced Russia speaking hackers to remain in Russia or others into specific countries affect the origin of access to Internet(s).
				- China's Informational Firewall changes the information internal and external environments, ingress and egress 
	- Communications:
		- [Crypto AG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_AG)
		- Printing Press:
			- Need of monastic organised caligraphers and informational control by the Papal institutions - was made open source subverting 
	- Kinetic Warefare
		- Mongol Biological Warfare of catapulting the dead over seized fortifications
		- Napalming a jungle in Vietnam
		- Slash and burn of retreating Slavic armies 

The physics of cyber is determined by shareholder value. Brian Snow, former director of Information Assurance for the NSA: *"I'm here to tell you that your cyber system continue to function and serve you not due to the expertise of your security staff, but solely due to the sufferance of your opponents"* - Grugq counters with: *"I'm here to tell you that your cyber espionage continues to function and serve you not due to the expertise of your intelligence staff but due to the sufferance of Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, etc"*

If Google wanted to shut down all NSA cyber operations in the Netherlands they could. It is just a bad political decisions in the Netherlands, but could Chad, South Sudan or Burma? Interestingly.

Robotaxies: Systems in Human space are not design to handle the messiness of those spaces. Funny videos not included here. People behave really weirdly in these - basically the treat them as Hotels.

Complex System fail in complex ways, because Reality is more complex than it seems.

Systems do not adapt to people
