# Browser Hardening


Is the scope of work such that it requires a browser such that it needs to be containerised?
- [[KASM-Workspaces]], there are also others - beware trading browser for docker misconfigurations

#### Countering Browser Fingerprinting 






The following is researched from various sources online.
- Minimalism - more means more unique (more privacy focus plugins)

Configuration management



TL;DR - Make you browser (if are privacy advocates or data-sharing absentees) as close to base Chromium as possible 

**Author's Opinions** 
>Consider the Leafy-Bug (Alh4zr3d) - Go Chrome with Google or Edge with Bing; but then its about what (content) you and where (machine) that made you consider Browser Fingerprinting. Browser fingerprinting exists, because privacy advocates or data-sharing absentees are fingerprintable from the fact browser telemetry are the data source to compare to the those that are not. Similar to the idea the TOR network traffic is a small percentage of the world internet traffic and is different from regular traffic. Basically is worth it for you (just because a,b,c all do this from some list is ?
