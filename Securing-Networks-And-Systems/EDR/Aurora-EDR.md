# Aurora 

Aurora EDR is a [[Sigma]]-based tool for writing detection alerts via Windows Event logs. According to [NexTron-Systems.com](https://www.nextron-systems.com/aurora/) *"The AURORA Agent is a lightweight and customisable EDR agent based on [Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma). It uses Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) to recreate events that are very similar to the events generated by Microsoft’s [Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) and applies Sigma rules and IOCs to them. AURORA complements the open Sigma standard with “response actions” that allow users to react to a Sigma match."*

- See [[ETW]]
- [[EDR]] for more broader articulation of the possible capabilities of vendors. 


It is everything that other EDRs aren’t: 
-   it is completely transparent and fully customisable due to the open Sigma rule set and configuration files
-   it saves 99% of the network bandwidth and storage
-   it works completely on-premises, no data leaves your network
-   it can be configured to use only a limited amount of resources*
