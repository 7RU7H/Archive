# Linux Defined

## Introduction 
Similar to other hub pages, but a broad connective article to all the [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) Concepts Files. 

Some of Linux and Open Source Software meta-rational for existence is for freedom, but also the freedom for big corporations to claim non-monopoly status to avoid anti-trust lawsuits. Cynicism regard symbotic and parasitic relationships aside, free and open software runs the world; computational timekeeping is a great example. When Governments get hacked because some open source software does not get enough funding, they fund open source.

If anyone has any issues with the descriptions of this article, I will instantly add them after verification, I probably incorrect or make some generalisation that is not fair at some point so.  


Linux is just the operating system kernel, originally just a boot loader. [Not as good of a meme as the GNU linux meme or sentence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy), but [GNU is family of linux distros that is only free and open sourced software](https://www.gnu.org/). 


## Kernel
Kernel control the hardware, detects and configures them for all reasons necessary for the operation of said hardware.

## Linux Places of Interest

There many websites dedicated as the users of Unix-based systems 

Althought there are many difference between distros a great wiki is the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/), even though it is for ArchLinux related information, its generally useful for troubleshooting and written and maintained by the similar if greater level of fanaticism as the Volunteer Microsoft Forum contributer, as the number of people to do provide to the great good is larger the more people you have depending on the overall quality of information. Both group providing an incredible contribution to the world that goes largely unnoticed.
