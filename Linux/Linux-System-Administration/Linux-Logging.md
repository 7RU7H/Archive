# Linux Logging


[[Linux-Hardening]]

[CrowdStrike:](https://www.crowdstrike.com/guides/linux-logging/advanced-concepts/) *"Linux uses a daemon called rsyslogd to process messages using the syslog protocol. This service evolved from the regular syslog daemon to the current enterprise-level logging system."* Its configuration file can be found at `/etc/rsyslog.conf` on Red Hat, Debian-based including [[Kali]], and Fedora. Its directives are located in `/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf`
