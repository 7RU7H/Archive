# NOPSEC 101

The inverse of [[OPSEC-101]], the information warfare to promote branding and reinforce identity over of external forces. The objective of NOPSEC is to focus your life and not enjoy the insanity of being paranoid and doing the weird loop-de-loop nonsensical and illogical behaviours of cultures while hacking or living life. This was scrapped from lived experiences and the residues of joy that I should share with the world dripping off my brain writing the Archive.

This is a work in progress, my plan is to make have very combined simple list and graph like extension to it like control flow and then have big bullet point list of say if you questioned my reasoning then the follow list of why each simple statement is a proof of concept and answer to why it works later.

## Tenents

1. Be Proactively Honest - talk all the time, do not be paranoid it is inefficient
	-  If you are an immoral shit to whomever then NOPSEC is not for you
    -  Have brutal clarity over your objectives and override culture.
    - Talk all the time and teach people everything that you know to create a cyclic loop of pedagogic progression
	- Cyber-Agencies and Authority have all the power and resources
	- You are not special and no one is, only the group and its effiecency is special
	- Have social media accounts for specific goal - want to program only follow programmers that are good
	- Use the algorhythms of insert-big-corp-here to aid in reinforcing the NOPSEC
	- Social Skills are the most OP skillset of human-vs-human interaction it is majority of how it interacts, why train to special punching move you only use once.
3. Be  Proactively Truthful - humbly recognise externally outnumbering
	- Be more aware of failings and shortcomings and weakness
	- Be more responsive to incidents with less stress and more fun, meaning fast progression
	- Be scientific
	- Reveal everything cooperative and coop-everything that someone else does better and acknowledge them, always pay tribute - everything will be reveal to you in time if you are open to looking
	- Reveal operational details - your TTPs, be open to criticism, enjoy everyone not being scarred
4. Be Proactively Open to modification and extension
	- Stop, Listen, Wait, Think and Learn from others 
	- Be open others' criticism
	- Be open others' humourous takes 
5. Review Operationalisation of NOPSEC and YOUR ID
6. Be tidy and organised
	- Human searching algrhythm for X element in a link list of where the fuck I put that X is 
7. Learn to use code, be explicit, be loud
	- Practice Logic to remove the illogical
	- Do not use code words it is abstraction that creates inefficiency
	- If you are loud then everyone know you are there, either you are food or not a threat - be a white blood cell to humanity
8. Use Crypto-nyms and have them setup prior to use
9. Be legal never worry and always will alway help others to help justify to others to end there fear
	- Examples:
		- Mob inquisitions historically are bad for everyone, including the mob.
10. Avoid contamination from procastinative activities. 
	1. Be concious of contamination over time
	2. Account meta data is collected as if were free money, automated by code and stored somewhere - removal of the non-relevant activities is important
11. Treat every everything is or is to be Zero Dayed
	1. Zero Trust Policy because being up to par with everything else in the environment is important, being shat on hurts time cleaning everything up
	1. Why [[TOR-Hidden-Services]] if you are all NOPSEC, 
12. Energy is life, work is required for fun, make you work fun or do something you enjoy
	- Make relaxation or recreate pure, do work that is basically fun, but challenging
	1. Do not operate from a location that is inseperate from relaxation or pure recreate
13. Schedule personal life and ESPECIALLY family time or your need to do non-objective task or your family will crawl that time out of you in a painful way
14. Keep person environment and life controband/crime free
	- Prisons of various types are suppose to be bad, why go
15. If you can listen to ANY authority then they will tell you stuff and save you alot of time and pain
16. Be mindful of any control, but especially your own control over your own actions, detirministically you might be doing shit, because you are just shit.
