# Security Policies

Bruce Schneier:*"Security is a process, not a product."*  


- Assets to be protected change over time, the risk components evolve and therefore response should accordingly.
- Each subsystem will have its own requirements and constraints, and so the risk assessment and the design of the security policy should be undertaken separately for each

- What are you trying to protect?
	- Cost to secure vs cost of breach - it X security policy worth its cost to secure and maintain
	- Is it defense mechanism - booby traps should be able to trap attackers not be too secure
	- How large is the attack surface?
- What are you trying to protect against?
	- Legal repercussions
- Who are you trying to protect against?
- What is the context of the policy?

Can you redesign the network connective to make it more secure(without cost - then consider cost)?
- Sensitive machines concentrated to a secure segmentation and only be accessible via a minimal number of routes or check-points - plus Network Filtering
- Netowkr Filtering

How can you protect your users from themselves?

How can the policy improve initial incident response time?
