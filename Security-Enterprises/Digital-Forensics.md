[Digital Forensics is the forensic examination of anything wherever computational data exists.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehxJZAGUaxY) The author consider the conceptual seperation of [[Security-Enterprises/Incident-Response]] and Digital Forensics a etymological imperative; simply Digital Forensics does not need Incident Response, but Incident Response requires techniques from Digial Forensics to evaluate data. Corporate definitions often coinside with the concatenating of tasks and title to save money.
