# Red Team Threat Intel

**Threat Intelligence (TI)** or **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** is the information, or TTPs (**T**actics, **T**echniques, and **P**rocedures), attributed to an adversary, commonly used by defenders to aid in detection measures.

Use of the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) , [TIBER-EU](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cyber-resilience/tiber-eu/html/index.en.html), and [OST Map]() frameworks to build understanding of the characteristics to which the Red Team Lead must implement a plan to emulate an APT.

## Tiber EU Framework

As a framework, [TIBER-EU](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cyber-resilience/tiber-eu/html/index.en.html) encompasses a set best practices. [ECB TIBER-EU white paper](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.tiber_eu_framework.en.pdf): *"The Framework for Threat Intelligence-based Ethical Red Teaming (TIBER-EU) enables European and national authorities to work with financial infrastructures and institutions (hereafter referred to collectively as 'entities') to put in place a programme to test and improve their resilience against sophisticated cyber attacks."*

## TTPs Mapping
With a Cyber Kill chain like [[Lockhead-Martin-Cyber-Kill-Chain]], [[Unified-Kill-Chain]] or [[Varonis-Cyber-Kill-Chain]] in combination with [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)and the [ATT&CK Navigator](https://mitre-attack.github.io/attack-navigator/) or [OST Map](https://www.intezer.com/ost-map/)

Mandiant Advantage,
Ontic,
CrowdStrike Falcon, 


## CTIs
C2 traffic based on gathered CTI is [malleable profiles](https://www.cobaltstrike.com/help-malleable-c2) and is analyzing behavior and actions of an adversaries' malware and tools to develop your offensive tooling that emulates similar behaviors or has similar vital indicators.
