# Red Team Recon
Miyamoto Musashi, author of A Book of Five Rings: The Classic Guide to Strategy, wrote: *“You win battles by knowing the enemy’s timing, and using a timing which the enemy does not expect.”* and *“Know your enemy, know his sword.”*

Red Teaming often requires both [[Passive-Recon]] and [[Active-Recon]]
