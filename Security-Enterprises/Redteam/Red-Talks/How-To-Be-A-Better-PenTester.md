## The Top Ten Reasons It Great To Be A PenTester 
##### Sans Pen Test HackFest Ed Skoudis Talk

This talk is themed on how it is great to be a PenTester and how this is actually hurting PenTester and their work. [This is an awesome talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTN7n7744B4). Here are my notes and take aways from the talk for future references and hopeful something to prime your learning before watching an Ed Skoudis talk.

1. Get to be special 
	- Do not abuse that and be cranky and obtuse - instead be kind, transparent and professional
1. Bling, babes and great hair - Ed Skoudis looks like Heisenberg... but with the Business Ethic and Professionalism of Gus and Mike
	- Narcissism is a cancer on yourself; it hold you back and your self-perception is in congruant to reality.
1. Money
	- It is well paid, but it technical and you could be lazy and scam! But **YOU COULD** actually provide good business value, which would also mean would get paid more for the value and price out the lazy!
1. Travelling around
	- It good for travel, but YOU can travel to much that life; child rearing and partners life is excluded for a seat to get somewhere or in hotel bed alone.
1. Squish Definitions! But if you conform to a strict definition, not be lazy, be more hacker and hack fun into you life by doing a more professional job.
	- You could say: "I am pentester, by definition I am doing my job" - and other say ok. Or as mentioned **YOU COULD** actually provide good business value and not just run scans and DO the fun part to make the reporting more fun. 
1. BigCorp like box checking, easy life, suck to be them
	- The do not want to do the stuff to be safe, but for you to up the value of PenTesting and yourself you need make it sexy for you recommendations to be **actionable**.
1.  Blow stuff and walking away from the explosion
	1. Write the report for Blue, not for other Red Teamers
	- To be more valuable you need to provide **actionable** fixes
	- To be more of the mindset of Blue Teamer will make you better at Red Teamer, if you can think of ways that you could defend against yourself and help them, you understand the offense to a greater extent.
	- TDLR; Help Blue, learn from Blue, be more Purple, to be every more RED!
1. Everyone wants shiny - Easy Wins, Are not always good; finding a even shiny way to root/system in is better!
	- But you probably phished your way in...and if you can keep doing something on the same company over and over again -THEN YOU PROBABLY YOU AREN'T TELLING THEM instructively in a **actionable** way
1. Friends, the vulnerable software and Red Teaming community
1. Write report that are the "suck" and thats ok - erm do not do that clearer reports mean you understood the information clearer and are a demonstrative written proof you can measure yourself on


**Avoid the race to the bottom mentality - it bad for you, you stagnate and decline... it drive value down and the rise of really crappy pen tests (RCPT)
	- Hurts industry
	- sullies the term pen test


#### Business needs..
1. Demand better - use a good methodlogy to be more focused on business value and transparency - read your finding, understand what is mean. Your job is explain in business terms!
1. Provide business goals not technical goals
1. Lower Travel cost Through Remote Pen Tests
	- Save business's money, through remote testing and tell business to spend it on security
	- Get provide your standard client image and remote access
	- PenTester can local Priv Esc remotely
1. Reject bad reports
1. Insist real world solutions for problem
	- Hardcore problem solving for real world problem is why you want this job.
1. Ask for method to verify that a fix is in place and working
	- Retesting is not fun, let business do it is good for them.
1. Reject bad copy and paste and insist on useful results
2. Realize that business focused results may cost a bit more... but don't let pen tester greedy.
	- Low cost pen tests are not good for either party
1. Kill those friends of pen testers
2. Offensive Counter Measures are a good thing
