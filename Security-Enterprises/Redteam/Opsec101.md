## Critical Information

Client Information:
Red Team information:
1. Activities, identities, plans, capabilities and limitations
1. Tactics, techniques and procedures
1. IPs, MAC addresses, public domains, hosted websites i.e phishing or "We use this OS or software!"

## Threat Analysis

Who is the adversary is?
What are the adversary’s goals?
What tactics, techniques, and procedures does the adversary use?
What critical information has the adversary obtained, if any?

## Vulnerabilities Analysis
DoD opsec: 
OPSEC vulnerability exists when an adversary can:
obtain critical information, 
analyse the findings, 
and act in a way that would affect your plans.

## Risk Assessment

The efficiency of the countermeasure in reducing the risk
The cost of the countermeasure compared to the impact of the vulnerability being exploited.
The possibility that the countermeasure can reveal information to the adversary

## Countermeasures 

“Countermeasures are designed to:
 prevent an adversary from detecting critical information, 
provide an alternative interpretation of critical information or indicators (deception), 
or deny the adversary’s collection system.”
