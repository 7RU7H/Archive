# Unified Kill Chain

Invented by [Paul Pols](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulpols) The Unified Kill Chain was originally developed in his master's thesis titled “[_Modeling Fancy Bear Attacks: Unifying the Cyber Kill Chain_](https://www.unifiedkillchain.com/assets/The-Unified-Kill-Chain-Thesis.pdf)”. The thesis was written for the executive master’s programme in Cyber Security by the University of Leiden, where Paul now teaches as a lecturer.*The Unified Kill Chain was developed through a hybrid research approach, combining design science with qualitative research methods. The Unified Kill Chain extends and combines existing models, such as Lockheed Martin's Cyber Kill Chain® and MITRE's ATT&CK™.*
