# Defense in Depth


[Defense in Depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)) is a strategy deployed to protect assets by creating multiple layer of security controls and practices to continually defend said assets - [inspired by the military strategy of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_in_depth).  It covers the Physical, Technical and Administrative to prevent and detect adversaries - protection through strategy, architecture (redundant, active and tacit or designed), policy (CIA triad, permissions, authenication) and active governace and continual review and improvement. It is not static strategy.   


It is the assumption that assets must be defended and that breaches will occur, in which preparation and architecture can defeat adversary thorugh understanding the faults of attacking and playing to the tacits strengths of architecting the infrastructure. It is a defensive layering of planned defenses of infrastructure devices and layout, software and hardware, policy and governance of a network such that access, from an attacker perspective, to most valuable assets are furtherest and most difficult from point of entry. It is a continual process of reducing the impact of breaches and creating a abstract layer traps of an expected path of an attacker for alerting stake holders.

It counters traditional ideas of a security posture that were primarily concerned with the perimeter. Instead of one obstical like a wall, Defense in Depth is the maze with all the monitoring and booby traps. It is about disrupting adversaries based on expected adversarial objectives securing everything from perimeter to and around assets. It is the layering of preventive measures at the perimeter, detection mechanicisms for visibility to adversary and also prevention to limit or constrain further intrusion; finally monitoring and capabilities of a security team.   

Consideration of countering:
- Persistence - not just [[Persistence]] - if assets are not checked or backuped or backups are compromised
	- Double ransomware attacks were attackers will just reencrypt everything
- Insider threats
- Human Error
- Accessibility, but securely
