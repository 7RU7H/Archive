# Attack Surface Reduction


Attack Vectors: are the Mitre Tactic Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) that used by adversaries to complete their objectives.

Attack Surface: is the surface area - abstract mathematical sense of space - of which attacks can be made against. It is scope of assets held by stake holder that define a shape. 

Attack Surface Reduction is the strategy of reducing the the area of asset attackability through:
- Accessibility
- Speedy Patching!
- Authenication and Authorization
- Sandboxing
- Brute Forcing protections and practices to make it expensive 
- Password/Ticket policies and rotations for users and machines
- Information disclosure prevent
- [[Defense-In-Depth]]
- Countering Human Error
- Countering Insider Threat 
- Collective Strength - Vulnerable legacy systems will targeted - secure them and segment them
- Data retention 
- Throughout Incident Response  
- Phishing Protections
