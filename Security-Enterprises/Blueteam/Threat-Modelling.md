Threat Modelling is modelling:
1. What functions do each systems and applications serve in the environment, identifying what systems and applications need to be secured.
	- If it has no purpose it is a security risk both as an human administrative oversight - both patching and defending
	- If is too useful, do not make your legitimate users subvert the security put in place to keep them and the assets safe.  
2. Assessing what vulnerabilities and weaknesses these systems. Adversaries do so to exploit your systems
3. Create actionable stategies and defensive measures to secure, monitor, maintain systems, but your users are the simpler to exploit than a system:
	- Give external contractors specific email accounts   
	- Make it easy for users to do there job safely
	- Don't create and fight against systems that promote repeative normality - make uses spam 2FA, Logins, doom-clicking (infinite click through - does not activate the attentive ration parts of the users brains)
1. Actuating policy to prevent reoccurence
