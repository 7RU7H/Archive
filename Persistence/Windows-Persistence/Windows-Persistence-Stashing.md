# Windows Stashing

Windows Stashing is just a name I made up to describe the hiding of files for return.

## Locations


- $Recycle.Bin Directory
	- In the [Equation Group Dumps](https://github.com/x0rz/EQGRP_Lost_in_Translation/blob/master/swift/DSL2opnotes.txt) the operator stashes a file in the recycling bin under an obfuscated name.
