YAML Ain't Markup Language

Properties of YAML files are:
- YAML is case-sensitive.
- Files should have the `.yml` extension.
- Spaces are used for indentation and not tabs.
- Comments are attributed using the `#` character.
- Key-value pairs are denoted using the colon `:` character.
- Array elements are denoted using the dash `-` character.
