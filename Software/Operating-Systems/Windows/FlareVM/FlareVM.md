# FlareVM

[GitHub Mandiant FlareVM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) project describes itself as: *"Welcome to FLARE-VM - a collection of software installations scripts for Windows systems that allows you to easily setup and maintain a reverse engineering environment on a virtual machine (VM). FLARE-VM was designed to solve the problem of reverse engineering tool curation and relies on two main technologies: [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) and [Boxstarter](https://boxstarter.org). Chocolatey is a Windows-based Nuget package management system, where a "package" is essentially a ZIP file containing PowerShell installation scripts that download and configure a specific tool. Boxstarter leverages Chocolatey packages to automate the installation of software and create repeatable, scripted Windows environments."*
