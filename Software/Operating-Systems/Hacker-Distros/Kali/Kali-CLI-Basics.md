# Kali Command Line Basics

The [Z Shell (zsh)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) ss the default shell on Kali it is extended `sh` shell with modern features.

`CTRL + P`, to change command line view either one line with user and host `kali@kali:` or titled with branch leading to a `$`


Really I recommend a terminal multiplexor like TMUX, but 
`SHIFT CTRL + T`  for new terminal window
`SHIFT CTRL + R`  split the window vertical

Open the file manager to the current working directory - useful for Bloodhound or any drag and drop activity.
```bash
thunar # or Thunar for some reason../
```
