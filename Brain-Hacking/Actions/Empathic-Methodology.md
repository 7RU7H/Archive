# Empathic Methodology

Do you need to talk?

Do not script anything - always be authentic

How many decisions have you taken today; be aware of yours and other social and cognitive fatigue 

How does chronicity affect you and your objectives 

What is the [[Social-Power]] dynamic?
- Regardless of status, would a..
	- Colombo-like approach  
	- Mirroring
	- Shutting up?
	- Other

If you do talk then everything is a negotiation?
- Are prepared?

1. Assessment Phase
	1. Separate the people from the problem 
		- Will they use [[Manipulation-Techniques]], can retain mutual objective driven direction 
		- Have reviewed [[Detecting-Deception]]
		- Can you now refocus on the Problem not the person?
	1. Focus on interests, not positions
	2. Invent options for mutual gain
	3. Insist on using objective criteria 
2. Engagement Phase
3. Transaction Phase

While listening is it...
- Too good to be true?
- Urgent is some way
- Are they a unknown proxy for known authority (person, not institution otherwise ID please)

Are managing silence?

Are you managing entropy?
- Either is novelty a factor in negotiation or is nullification through attrition 

If trust is required are you using [Robin Dreeke's Mantra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3XR4QrJyxA) to gain another's trust:
- Seeking their thoughts and opinions
- Talk in terms of their priorities and objectives
- Validating without judging them
- And give them choices

Narrative control:
1. Is now a bad time to talk?
2. Is it a ridiculous idea ...?
3. Are you against ...?
4. Have you given up on ...? - If they have ghosted you; you have probably been explaining or educating 
	1. Get a That's Right - talk in terms of their priorities and perspective; and go silent till a That's Right or..
	2. say: "It's sounds like I have left something out."
5. Letting out "No" a little at a time.
	- How am I supposed to do that? - Forces empathy
	- If countered, you have more clarity
6. Your offer is very generous, but I'm afraid it just doesn't work for me - Removes external criteria
7. Sounds like you have place you like to start (Alternative: Sounds like you got a something you'd like to discuss) - as a response to how are you? (Authorial note: this is a very negotiation setting specific Tip beware this wont work in the  regular day to day)
8. What makes you ask? - Question behind the question
9. Seems like you have a good reason for asking? - Control time, control silence
10. It seems like you have a reason for not doing... - re-engagement while they feel safe and respected
