# Learning To Continue Learning Better

Results take time and require hindsight you never get till you have it

#### From "Script-Kiddie / Junior Dev / etc."  Towards Professionalism

Milestones in capability and change in oneself and mostly are aided by cross-domain concepts and multi-disciplinary combinations 

- I found Fowler's [[Refactoring]] book and various talks about [[Refactoring]] are significant step in Problem Solving

#### Encoding with Generation

- Passive Reading (just reading) is worse than Active Reading (lookup words, activity have to concentrate to understand, etc) in order to learn the content. The more Generation of Words (expending mental energy to understand a word in *some way*) improves potential result of you learning a topic.
- Generation words as a encoding strategy will improve reading overall, by fundamentally teaching Generation as a activity improve learning.
- Do real tests to challenge yourself to really improve and learn

Rather, it seems like just knowing the format of the test and having some experience with different encoding strategies is enough (separately and likely additively together) to lead to superior encoding.

#### Deliberate Practice

Authorial note - this was mostly because I have observed that lots of time doing something will improve you and I am just testing my biases. 10,000 hours is only good if the quality is good who would have thunked that... from [What People Get Wrong About Deliberate Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbUOY9ioIqw) 

#### Active Learning

Passive learning is a master tells the student about a topic; Active learning is about forcing the student to have think about a topic
- Active Recall 
- Group work
- Games
- Self-explanations
- Hands-on activities
- Flashcards
- Test taking
- Problem solving
- Project-based learning
- Contrasting cases
- Teaching other
- Mindmaps
- Worked examples

Mastery is:
- Organisation of Knowledge structure is basically how good is your Graph of connections to all topic external and the topic itself. 
- Recall and Application
- Making Predication about 
- Practice

#### A Simple Way to Learn Complex Skills 

Break a complex task into parts and spend time being attentive to the singular part before combining together other parts of the task.
