# Learning

This basically hack together and I think a better way to teach how to learn more effetively than [Justin Sung](https://www.youtube.com/c/JustinSung) as really the key to all learning is a compression and hyper-connectively. This a more effective way as to memorise this simple short sentence per-concept manual. 

- Practice the 4 types of learning with respect to complexity of the topic, port number need repeatition - AD exploitation requires graphing
- Exercise: Increase your ability to take in new information, by chemical hacking your brain to learning 15% more effectively (also improves mental health, sleep schedules - the first thing a mental health profession will check if you are ill or heading toward being unwell is how much exercise you do).
- One to four hours a day is better than 15 hours a day, but if you want to work alot then pivot and manage deep and shallower work intervals
- Listen to listen, don't listen to respond
- Be humble 
- Try the least smart person in the room surrounded by smarter people.

This will not make a genius in a week or a month, but will make a better student and teacher over the course months. It is a investment that willl last a lifetime. But with that stated you must **PRACTICE IT**, like incident response you must actually try to respond to the incident in the first place otherwise you have failed.

## Time Investment 

- Increase Cognitive Load - Dont use the 25 mins work 5 mins break method
	- Have deep and shallow Work sections 
	- Interweave Practice and Theory 
		- Read a Page, find the important parts if you dont remmeber them then improve you cognitive load on reading to finding those parts again and re-read
- Critical Reflection of technique, what do and what does not work
	- Seperate an amount time to recall after Deep and Shallow type of application of learning.
- Learning Objectives
	- What level of learning I am practicing?
	- Pre study to figure out the relationships, but delay note taking
	- After priming an understand solidification concept by concept by laying and spreading out over time the concepts that are relvant to the overall learning plan over a long period of time being generious in how stupid you actually are and not too tight in time scheduling.

## How we fundementally remember

Symbiotic relationship of **Encoding** memories and **Recalling**. Remain calm and remember you will forget things and that is ok. The important information is the you schedule a set amount of time to understand what it relevant to you given your objective of what you must/want to learn. Encoding is linearly following the day to day doing of the tasks to learn. The old *insert social media or old media format* of telling to just do the stuff. Be kind to yourself allow yourself time to fail and rememer everyone starts somewhere and that in utero, we all start off growing from arsehole. Just do not be a arsehole to others or yourself. Recall the things that matter and getting stressed by what does and does not matter is just you being a silly arsehole trying to grow. Growing is always painful, take it slow and then speed it up. Start somewhere and start at some point, but make time to remember to remember the good things you did tto achieve your objectives. Even if it was a bad day, you took 30 minutes to read or watch something about the thing you wantedd to do or learn to then do more of it. No person has infinite time to remember to to encode everything do not worry.   

## Learning Typology 

My simplified | Explanation | Sung's Terms | Ascii Art Figure references
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Repetition** | Doing something that is of a domain you want to learn | Isolation | Figure 1 
**Practice** | Applying/Gaining understanding by perform action relative to the domain | Applied / Related | Figure 2 
**Mapping** | Drawing connection with what notetaking device mapping the domain of information, asking you brain how is objects in this domain connected | Relationships / Groups | Figure 3
**Graphing** | With map of a domain of connection, add logic, maths, metainformation, heirarchies, prioritisation, etc | Judgement / prioritisation | Figure 4

    	^          |

    [IDEA d] <- [IDEA c]

```


## Additional 

- **Priming** - Before learning a concept do shallow research of the topic for a short time, then take break to try to connect everything - THEN watch/attend video lecture, conference do the lab, etc - Taking notes to reconnect everything in a more "Correct" way from you shallow research.

Priming is Psycholinguistics term to describe in modern colloqial termed a "triggering", in the context of learning we are gaining a brief overview with the need to understand in any meaningful extent. 

- [[Black-Box-Method]], Black-Boxing a concept or problem.

- **Feynmanesque Teaching It to Compress it**

Teaching the domain of information you have somewhat learnt helps by using recall and deliberately trying to compress the information to explain it to someone else or through a medium like text or video.  You strengthen connection while re-encoding a more compressed version of what was learnt.

- **Spacing**

Spacing 

## My take - Pivoting, Globalising and Allowing for mundane tasking

I personally do not avocate spacing, I say pivoting is better if you globalise the domain you want to learn to **AS MANY** areas and aspect of your life. Whether its thinking about an RFC while having sex to not DoS yourself, leaving the only thing to pick up a book about x86 instructions or to when sad, tired, imposter-syndromed-out-the-wazzo do a code along about rest API design or hack along for CTF, Vulnerable machine or Bug Bounty Program.

If all there is only classical music triangles, theory about playing the triangle and it in the context of classical music, triangle social media... and that is all there is because you want that to be that way you are not going to get rid of any the stuff mentioned and probably going to get good at playing the triangle and understanding the triangles role in classical music.  

If you hitting walls move on a doing something easier, but always similar.

Building things: make an AD lab, a website, etc - if you can build them you can break into them or harden them.

Put books in the toilet to read, if was a instrument carry or have smaller instrument to play, leave what you need to learn everywhere or take it with you. 

Play the instrument in front the television, play the jingles, practice holding or playing ostenato, but for hacking related - have an account for only hacking related mediam stuff and prioritise going to this account over any others.
