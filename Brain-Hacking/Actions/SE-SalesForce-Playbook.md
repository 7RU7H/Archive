Here are the 11 rules from the playbook:
**1. Think BIG, Have Attitude:**
- Think big (dollars and scope), not just the immediate opportunity in front of you.
- Drop smaller deals to focus on the big ones.
**2. No deal is won or lost alone:** 
- Work with the entire team to close deals. Even though sales can seem like an individual game at times, work with your sales engineer and other sales team members to make sure you’re doing the right thing.
**3. Connect the dots:**
- Always call with a plan.
- Don’t cold call to chat or use a templated pitch.
- Be creative. Use information that’s not easily available.
**4. Focus on 'why not’:**
- Instead of thinking about why a deal will close, focus on why it might not.
- That’s usually where the pain point is.
**5. Always take the deal off the table:**
- Make sure every deal is closed if it's ready to close.
**6. Get your face in the place:**
- Meet your customers in person.
**7. Fun facts build instant credibility:**
- Try to learn everything about your customer.
**8. Be proactive on all paperwork:**
- Make sure all paperwork is in place. Losing a deal on paperwork is embarrassing.
**9. Always get quid pro quo in negotiations:**
- Don't be afraid to ask for more and say no when needed.
**10. Share best practices:**
- Share them with your team and learn from them. Your teammates will be more willing to help you back.
**11. Go after game changers:**
 - Look for deals that can take the company to the next level.
