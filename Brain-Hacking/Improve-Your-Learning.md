# Learning

This basically hack together and I think a better way to teach how to learn more effetively than [Justin Sung](https://www.youtube.com/c/JustinSung) as really the key to all learning is a compression and hyper-connectively. This a more effective way as to memorise this simple short sentence per-concept manual. 

- Practice the 4 types of learning with respect to complexity of the topic, port number need repeatition - AD exploitation requires graphing
- Exercise: Increase your ability to take in new information, by chemical hacking your brain to learning 15% more effectively (also improves mental health, sleep schedules - the first thing a mental health profession will check if you are ill or heading toward being unwell is how much exercise you do).
- One to four hours a day is better than 15 hours a day, but if you want to work alot then pivot and manage deep and shallower work intervals
- Listen to listen, don't listen to respond
- Be humble 
- Try the least smart person in the room surrounded by smarter people.

This will not make a genius in a week or a month, but will make a better student and teacher over the course months. It is a investment that willl last a lifetime. But with that stated you must **PRACTICE IT**, like incident response you must actually try to respond to the incident in the first place otherwise you have failed.


## How we fundementally remember

Encoding 

Recall

## Learning Typology 

- **Repetition** - Doing something that is of a domain you want to learn

- **Practice** - Applying/Gaining understanding by perform action relative to the domain 

- **Mapping** - Drawing connection with what notetaking device mapping the domain of information, asking you brain how is objects in this domain connected

- **Graphing** - With map of a domain of connection, add logic, maths, metainformation, heirarchies, prioritisation, etc


## Additional 

- **Priming** - Before learning a concept do shallow research of the topic for a short time, then take break to try to connect everything - THEN watch/attend video lecture, conference do the lab, etc - Taking notes to reconnect everything in a more "Correct" way from you shallow research.

Priming is Psycholinguistics term to describe in modern colloqial termed a "triggering", in the context of learning we are gaining a brief overview with the need to understand in any meaningful extent. 

- **Feynmanesque Teaching It to Compress it**

Teaching the domain of information you have somewhat learnt helps by using recall and deliberately trying to compress the information to explain it to someone else or through a medium like text or video.  You strengthen connection while re-encoding a more compressed version of what was learnt.

- **Spacing**

Spacing 

## My take - Pivoting, Globalising and Allowing for mundane tasking

I personally do not avocate spacing, I say pivoting is better if you globalise the domain you want to learn to **AS MANY** areas and aspect of your life. Whether its thinking about an RFC while having sex to not DoS yourself, leaving the only thing to pick up a book about x86 instructions or to when sad, tired, imposter-syndromed-out-the-wazzo do a code along about rest API design or hack along for CTF, Vulnerable machine or Bug Bounty Program.

If all there is only classical music triangles, theory about playing the triangle and it in the context of classical music, triangle social media... and that is all there is because you want that to be that way you are not going to get rid of any the stuff mentioned and probably going to get good at playing the triangle and understanding the triangles role in classical music.  

If you hitting walls move on a doing something easier, but always similar.

Building things: make an AD lab, a website, etc - if you can build them you can break into them or harden them.

Put books in the toilet to read, if was a instrument carry or have smaller instrument to play, leave what you need to learn everywhere or take it with you. 

Play the instrument in front the television, play the jingles, practice holding or playing ostenato, but for hacking related - have an account for only hacking related mediam stuff and prioritise going to this account over any others.
