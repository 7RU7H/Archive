# NOPSEC 101 

NopSec != [OopSec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StSLxFbVz0M)

The inverse of [[OPSEC-101]], the information warfare to promote branding and reinforce identity over of external forces. The objective of NOPSEC is to focus your life and not enjoy the insanity of being paranoid and doing the weird loop-de-loop nonsensical and illogical behaviours of cultures while hacking or living life. This was scrapped from lived experiences and the residues of joy that I should share with the world dripping off my brain writing the Archive. This is not a replacement for OPSEC, but more a yin-yang or Taoist addition - The wise man can hear NOPSEC in the wind. 


This is a work in progress, my plan is to make have very combined simple list and graph like extension to it like control flow and then have big bullet point list of say if you questioned my reasoning then the follow list of why each simple statement is a proof of concept and answer to why it works later.

## Why Pure OPSEC is Bad m'kay

OPSEC is still important, but this article is how that too much makes it is also like schizophrenia - psychological debilitating and reduces your lifespan by decades.
- Paranoia - Stress and efficient human computation surrounded what is feared, potential, uncertain.
- Meta-Self-Imposed-Street-Light-Effect: Attractiveness of self-knowledge is based on secret knowledge leading to illogical conclusion and circulatory assumption building 
- WHICH then requires great organisational shifts in self and organisation self-reflection on why ideology, models, cognition patterns and framework are not the best.
- Primes your brain to optimise searching for that which you have primed you brain to look for - aggressive filtering out making openness to novelty or more important novel and improve ways of anything less possible to mentalise
- Worldview is not meta enough to then understand the cost basis for wasting time doing something
- Communicatively and Computationally inefficient, more work required to do anything from thinking about it, to encryption to bureaucracy, - basically a I can or cannot do X because of Y Opsec for expolated actually reason Z that is then translate for others A...


## The Pillars of NOPSEC


Promises - Truth - Trust
Pedagogy - Scientific
Communicative efficiency - Computationally efficiency - Adaptability - Open - Logical


## Tenents

1. Be proactively inquisitive 
1. Be proactively Honest - talk all the time, do not be paranoid it is inefficient
	-  If you are an immoral shit to whomever then NOPSEC is not for you
	-  Have brutal clarity over your objectives, override culture and biases.
	- Ask yourself if any biases may affect your thinking or others?
	- Talk all the time and teach people everything that you know to create a cyclic loop of pedagogic progression
	- Cyber-Agencies and Authority have all the power and resources
	- You are not special and no one is, only the group and its efficiency is special
	- Have social media accounts for specific goal - want to program only follow programmers that are good
	- Use the algorithms of insert-big-corp-here to aid in reinforcing the NOPSEC
	- Social Skills are the most OP skillset of human-vs-human interaction it is majority of how it interacts, why train to special punching move you only use once.
	- Be grateful to show appreciation
1. Be diligently Truthful - humbly recognise externally outnumbering
	- Be more aware of failings and shortcomings and weakness
	- Be more responsive to incidents with less stress and more fun, meaning fast progression
	- Be scientific
	- Practice gratitude to accepting of actualities that are positive in everyday life
	- Conduct personal review, see every failure as learning opportunity
	- Ask questions to be curious to solve more problems and understand how to solve more problems to solve more problems
	- Reveal everything cooperative and coop-everything that someone else does better and acknowledge them, always pay tribute - everything will be reveal to you in time if you are open to looking
	- Reveal operational details - your TTPs, be open to criticism, enjoy everyone not being scarred
4. Be customisable; Open to modification and extension

	- Be open others' criticism
	- Be open others' humorous takes
	- Be open to not extending beyond the bounds of what ends up a rabbithole
	- Be empathetic and not sympathetic

		- Am I emotional primed to respond 
1. Be proactively positive - make your life more valuable to yourself
	1. Life takes longer the more depressed you are, but you get more fun and happiness from the same amount of time it just seems to go quick
2. Review Operationalisation of NOPSEC and YOUR ID
3. Be tidy and organised
	- Human searching algorithm for X element in a link list of where the fuck I put that X is 
4. Learn to use code, be explicit, be loud
	- Practice Logic to remove the illogical
	- Do not use code words it is abstraction that creates inefficiency
	- If you are loud then everyone know you are there, either you are food or not a threat - be a white blood cell to humanity
5. Use Crypto-nyms and have them setup prior to use OR speak and advocate for common Sociolect usage that is both striving to be scientific and logically
6. Be legal - ethical affiliation    
	-  ...never worry and always will always help others to help justify to others to end there fear
	- No blackmail, no threats, no need to martyr yourself
	- Examples:
		- Mob inquisitions historically are bad for everyone, including the mob.
9. Treat every everything is or is to be Zero Day-ed 
	1. Zero Trust Policy because being up to par with everything else in the environment is important, being shat on hurts time cleaning everything up
	1. Why [[Tor-Hidden-Services]] if you are all NOPSEC 
10. Energy is life, work is required for fun, make you work fun or do something you enjoy
	- Make relaxation or recreate pure, do work that is basically fun, but challenging
	1. Do not operate from a location that is inseparable from relaxation or pure recreate
11. Schedule personal life and ESPECIALLY family time or your need to do non-objective task or your family will claw that time out of you in a painful way
	 - Relations, social ability in build, maintained, retained at home with family
12. Keep person environment and life contraband/crime free
	- Prisons of various types are suppose to be bad, why go
	- Most people are happy when they feel they are making impact and doing something that has some meaningful  good, recognise that other may need some help and being there  to provide that no matter how insignificant that may be may actually be really good for that other person.
13. If you can listen to ANY authority then they will tell you stuff and save you a lot of time and pain
14. Be mindful of any control, but especially your own control over your own actions, deterministically you might be doing shit, because you are just shit. 
15. Avoid contamination from procrastination activities. 
	1. Be conscious of contamination over time
	2. Account meta data is collected as if were free money, automated by code and stored somewhere - removal of the non-relevant activities is important
