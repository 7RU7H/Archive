##### Stupidity, Learning and Strategy


[YouTube: Patrick Boyle Adam Robinson - Strategy for Investing and for Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWodxNjmIwQ), description: *"Today in a podcast style episode I welcome my friend Adam Robinson who has had possibly the most interesting career of anyone I know. He was a teenage Chess prodigy who trained with Bobby Fischer as Fischer prepared to play Boris Spassky for the 1972 world championship – in what has gone on to be known as The Match of The Century. He was an undergrad at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and later earned a law degree at Oxford University. He cracked the SAT and other standardized tests launching the Princeton Review Company – which he later sold. Adam is an Artificial Intelligence pioneer, a quantitative trader, a New York Times best-selling author, and an all-round master of strategy. His company Robinson Global Strategies provides macro research to some of the world’s most successful hedge funds. Adam's newest book How Not to be Stupid is one of the very few books to be endorsed by Warren Buffett."*


Stupidity is overlooking or dismissing conspicuously crucial information; Stupidity is also the cost of intelligence. *"It takes a lifetime to build reputation and ten minutes to ruin it".* - Warren Buffet. Below is a bullet point set of important statements per state that I noted and compiled together, below that are more statements that were conversation points that were not abstract enough for the model, but are interesting or related.

Internal State
- Calmness retention is normalise harmony at a specific breathing and heartbeat levels that are also controllable
	- Distracted internal states are commonly the problem 
- Comply by the rules - discretion is next error; Embed lessons in rules 
- Do not be partially systematic, always be systematic
	- Optimisation is just knowing what to no have to check, because systematised rule set system to handle checks and dismissal based on criteria
- Rehearsal observable testing of capability (practice with intent as cycle of feedback and response) 
	- Simulated events - practice exams, treat it like an exam
- In observing others making mistakes you must create learnable and memorable concepts
External State
- Outside of normal environmental of which you rehearsed task
- Rehearsal for external states - rehearsal is not practice is committing to intuition/automating, muscle memory, etc 
- Think in graphs and rules not lists, but if you must need a list it needs to be short enough to be contained within a node
- Experiment with exactitude
- Situate the entire external state such that luck is objectified by others as the reason for your success
State of Play
- What crucial information would be really stupid if you dismissed or missed?
- What Rule of Play to prevent error is most immediate?
- What is your edge?
- What is the result of applying a model of prioritisation
- Can turn the problem into one you are more competent at?
- What discrete values are at play and must be accounted for - UI does not show some value in a game (time to travel some distance to some destination)?
Administrative State
- Manage what should and should not be autonomic tasks
- Empower a Wingmen to counter focus overhead and tunnelling
- Amount of Information must be balanced with decision making capability
- Hierarchy of states including an emergency state to step back and stop current operations and return to sensory or strategically viable position were losses are not taken - consider ahead of time you need it
- Spend time to not being stupid rather than being smart
- Keep it simple
- Recognise complexity, then break it down for parts, patterns and puzzles
- Spend time trying to be smart to really be creative, simply to induce open mind 
- Spend time listening observing others - musicality comes more from applied expertise in listening to others - does not mean you need to be a expert take something from it, that is still quality
- Avoiding Error Management - A and B scored differently, both the same mistakes, B just caught the mistake.
	- Know the common mistakes
	- Make all the mistakes 
	- Systematise rules to not make those mistakes till intuitive and ...
	- Remember this takes a lot of time
- Arsenal inventory should be a quarterly activity not a regular activity - strictly upgrade by learning the tool a bit or getting a new tool - do not be tool of tools
- How to initiate and develop strategies to retain and return when broken optimal internal game state?

Rules of Learning
- When recording your mistakes, make sure you extract the correct lesson
- In observing others making mistakes you must create learnable and memorable concepts otherwise the same mistake is replicated and you are `a * 1.5 ^ 2` the fool.

Insightful  statements:

Thinking with check lists in the wrong scenario.

Error handling Systemetise Rules - embed the lesson in some kind of rule
- Pokeyoke factories in Japan: a task must first be finished    

When everything is too weird and you are at loss or losing hard, If computational sensor hand over to human (fighter pilot) - consider what you should do ahead of time

The better player is always lucky - that player has situated the state of play to be that player has defined through play

Monger: spend time trying not to be stupid to smart;
Rule 1: Do not lose money
Rule 2: See Rule 1
- The affect being that by trying not to lose money you will attempt to not rather than introduce discrepancies

Buffet's Punch Card Investment Strategy - you only get a number of times to invest.

Monger and Buffet: Make it as simple as possible
