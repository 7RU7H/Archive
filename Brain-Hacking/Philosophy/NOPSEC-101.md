# NOPSEC 101 

The purpose of writing and refining this page is excise of trying to write well and write short essays about complex topics. I would the first person any room to enjoy the minutia of the almost perfect OPSEC system.

Short essays

TLDR:
Premise -> OPSEC is very expensive and form a NOPSEC perspective has weird issues at a micro and macro scale that in the long term result that misaligned from the original objective.

OPSEC 
Propose NOPSEC as joke and superset of OPSEC  


To begin abstractly, consider a informational reference frame which has the properties of causality, entropy and negentropy exists.

Locard's Principal of Exchange applied


OPSEC is use to achieve an outcome with the least moves possibles that must be the least visible possible, with the least relational data points that as cluster could be interpreted as the cause of action.  

NOPSEC is where you can use OPSEC, it is just appreciation that the least moves possibles with the least visibility affect on the environment for a result is not always plausably possible. 

Then inversely ... and excessively materialise 

Cheating at snooker. 
How can you play snooker in with OPSEC? Proxies? 
- Just moved the problem to another vector with more human mistakes and issues to avoid using technology
- And if you use technological proxy like a special gun that fires a special bullet that can knock the Black ball in, you have the technical debt of R&D, Manufacture, Training, Disposal, Implanting and maintain persistence, Access control management for development ... and that is before making the shot. For the
Post action analytical costs for concerned sides are huge. 

The amount of Locard Principle of Exchange creation is shifted to more secure areas of the environment that if that burnt before or after ...

Fallacy of attribution is that is there is only some many combinations of who did anything that OPSEC become mathematically just psychological gaming of OPSEC user to help stave of flight responses? 


If you can use NOPSEC you can walk into the room exchange information to allow you then move the ball in front of all witnesses and leave. You had to have the correct information and payload delivery in the first place to be there, do execute the task and be able to leave. 


Recursive acknowledgement of participant games - X knows that Y knows that X knows each both know A and have proof that opposition knows about A. 

OPSEC - why is cant do what NOPSEC can,

Conclusion




NOPSEC != [OopSec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StSLxFbVz0M) and is the argument for inverse of [[OPSEC]] and bettering your OPSEC be being more conscious of is affect on your campaigns, life, etc. OPSEC is not secrecy. OPSEC is a set of ideals on top a lot tools that obfuscate whether you operational secure - just because did not say X you still tacitly said Y. Locard's Principle of exchange always exist. NOPSEC and OPSEC are not for everyone. Do you have a working Quantum Computer and the staff to analyse and store complex states that very few people can understand? No, even if you did, good luck. This is also the result of not having tendencies to want Hacking other people or a working Quantum Computer or the budget.

This page is like saying game hacking more powerful than getting someone else to play the game so you do not have culpability. The informational state of the game is changed, the useful idiot you got to play the game still has to play the game like everyone else - just more sneaky. 

Also with 18 years of (as of 2024) potential Intel and AMD hardcorded exploitable RCEs, firmware for Motherboards and components, backdooring in Assembly instruction sets, Software and Network protocols and probably anywhere else. Where the first Quantum computation was *confirmed* publicly in 2000 making all encryption just way of at least making everything not absolute observable to everyone else. Are OPSEC proponents not accounting for the noise of the internet of the total unobservable chaos of all that information in transit and at rest.
 
This is not a replacement for OPSEC or is this a avocation to just NOPSEC. NOPSEC is just a name to challenge OPSEC as a way of functioning. 

NOPSEC is a the supreme art of warfare by the control informational space without physical confrontation, where OPSEC is used in a articulately controlled when required. This page is here to attempt to explain that cyberware does not need OPSEC always, that informational warfare disrupts cyberware and that one is greater than the other.
#### Faults of OPSEC 

If you apply a compartmentalised approached to both OPSEC and NOPSEC, then you are not thinking purely in terms of OPSEC, but also how to use information to enhance strategic position in all aspects of life, not just whatever you were needing OPSEC for. Pure OPSEC thinking is bad:
- Modern OPSEC is a reaction to people being caught not as a unified method with whatever agent of change (hacking for example) you are using to create change 
- No amount of OPSEC will save you - Locard principle of exchange will always count against you; Logistics of everything you touch and do is also cognitive overhead
- Side channel attacks, cold boot attacks, backdoor in firm,soft,whatever wares, supply chain attacks, credentials and asset management will always exist
- RND is a nightmare
- Sometimes letting everyone know or knowing what is known is the play - being open about financial statements prevents investigation and also prevent blindspots created by self-perpetuation lies to perpetuate **incorrect** ways to operate
- Technical, Time, Cost, Life expensive
- Paranoia is bad it is a efficient, recursive and full of endless cognitive and logical rabbitholes - it like depression OPSEC paranoia is like Paranoid schizophrenia is psychological debilitating and reduces your lifespan by decades, both kill you slowly. Paranoia ts like malicious creativity from reactivity. The less you know the more fear and illogical you become
	- Increased cognitive overload for long negative strategic understanding of the informational battlefield 
- Secret knowledge creates heighten egotism, lack of empirical testing - you are not measuring your arsenal by metrics, but by feeling.
- Secrets are stored and handled differently in the brain, secrets are easy to forget unless they are attached to some emotion based on tangible cognitive relation to something cultural and reoccurring - pride, shame, etc but not traumatically so. 
- Meta-Self-Imposed-Street-Light-Effect: Attractiveness of self-knowledge is based on secret knowledge leading to illogical conclusion and circulatory assumption building 
- Update fatigue: at some point you will be blindsided by informational asset management that you have keep secret
- Limits creativity and optional, you are filtering everything actionable through a cognitive algorithm about when, how, why, who, what device, route,etc. You are never formless, flexible and always fighting the last war.
- Primes your brain for optimise searching of whatever OPSEC related concepts are fore fronted by habit aggressive filtering out making openness to novelty and reinforces patterns of assessment that either recursively become more paranoid or are gullible.  
- Worldview is not meta enough to then understand the cost basis for wasting time doing something - every Government, Institution and powerful group have better resources to manage all the above defensively and offensively and have been retain the knowledge of how to operate for thousands of years, because they have been use OPSEC for thousands of years.


OPSEC in modern Red Teams is just be as observable legitimate and benign as possible. Being as close to normality where your operation has a economy of actions that reflect the security of your position. So it then about what, how and why are using computers for in the first place and is that true to the objective in meta and strategic sense. OPSEC being a requirement and a cost to choices, time, resource and practically everything accept observability. OPSEC is required for fighting crime and APTs (you have an entire organisation to provide idiot proofing and arsenal), but most people are not doing that and are not part of organisation.


#### NOPSEC is actually not  `nop$Security`


It is an attempt to state the efficiency and limitations of OPSEC therefore make it a sunk cost fallacy and one, which always attract the attention of those looking for patterns of OPSEC. NOPSEC is kind of like artistic authenticity, honest and reflection of observations and then about your capability to act internally and externally to accomplish objectives. NOPSEC becomes intuitive from a strategically connected tactic, fluid and improvisational: The wise man can hear NOPSEC in the wind. NOPSEC expands focus on your health, life and choices and not the insane.

- Acknowledgement of the entire field of informational and cyberware:
	- Information warfare reinforces identity and control over external forces.
	- By having Identicators of Continuation you control adversaries attempting to use your identity as cover, while have [[Identity-And-Access-Management]]
- Open acknowledgement and definition regulates action on objectives. 
	- Being to truest self or truest group to some ideal as part of the set of objectives, if that does not conform to the collective algorithm of historical legal actualities then your or your group are the problem unto themselves.
- It recognises that everything is breached or backdoored to focus on using computer for the highest purpose possible in strategic and quality of life purposes. Rather dismissing it till device is no longer usable
- Like personal reality, NOPSEC is what you can get away with accept Locard Principle of exchange as part of the agent of change, rather than limit potential change.
- Be proactively inquisitive, but do not click the link! Curiosity leads to great knowledge and understanding 
- Be proactively Honest about yourself, environment, fundamentals (time, health, reasoning) your adversaries
	- Clear strategy and planning aids pursuit of objectives, secrets and obfuscation create complexity in being able to think 
- Forces operator to take a observational step back assessing costs rather than quality of some technology, asset, etc but its relevance for the campaign and subsequent campaigns.
- By engaging legitimately your place in the environment is legitimised  
- The benefits of interconnectivity and open communication are then beneficial rather than an issue 
- OPSEC does not encourage Socialisation as it is a vector of enumeration and data    triangulation from exposure. If you computer are your passion you are generally around computers not people, therefore you are more exploitable to SE. 
- Talking engages the brain in subsequent logic fault enumeration, if you too paranoid to talk your can't think about it meaningfully; meaning you can practice open
	- Empiricism in this century Printing Press, Wheel, etc 
	- Gratitude
	- Commonality
	- Pedagogy
	- Bias affect reduction
- NOPSEC leads to adversary over-confidence and for you a measured operation understanding of your asset value.
- TTPs are then subject to scrutiny, therefore by conforming to environment you will create patterns of life of ethically and trustable behaviour - limited adversary emulate and hijacking your OPSEC TTPs
- Dumping devices and not troubleshooting leads to the absolute technical debt of all future operations as a flat cost that will always lead to compromise
- If you are an immoral or ideological unacceptable to leading informational, cyber, social-economic powers no amount of OPSEC will hide your
- What is secret can be kept secret by your conquerors and be use as exploitable blackmail - then you are a tool with a lifecycle and not a agent of operationalised objectives
- Dependencies and triage become more like real organisations reflecting the environment and then personal will to optimise that to a higher form
- Recognition of the truth of that you are not special and no one is
- Recognition of the truth of  your capabilities rather the continuous impostor syndrome (or hiding it because OPSEC issues have weird affects) 
- Be not needing OPSEC to function you can have failings and learn from them and not dump and then have to rebuild everything
- Social media use must have purpose, because you have to manage time and empathetic commonality
- Use the algorithms of insert-big-corp-here to aid in reinforcing the NOPSEC
- You operate all the time not when is OPSEC or if you have OPSEC infrastructure in place - you will improve more quickly
- You engage in discourse and ask questions and solve more problems and understand more, rather than acknowledging everything single web page you visit is a connection of your culpability in some investigation 
- Let everyone else be stupid and hack all the things, you shouldn't because its stupid. Then learn about it in detail on Labs on ethical hacking sites, without losing the ability to touch a computer for 4 plus years
- You get feedback and that can be acted upon
- You accept that to most people, people that are good with computers are like wizards that are not trusted, be like a Witcher and you are facing the ethical and technical monsters of our time - rather than ostrocisation 
	- If you are loud then everyone know you are there, either you are food or not a threat - be a white blood cell to humanity
	- Similar to physical security, if you are dressed in the assumed role people think that is what you are there to do...
	- - ...never worry about h anything
	- No blackmail, no threats, no need to martyr yourself
	- Examples:
		- Mob inquisitions historically are bad for everyone, including the mob.
- You invest in the future good and current good and are not tied to the operationally complex, which has a lifespan 
- Your Identity is a weapon and defensive tool - I only operate with X patterns adversary have to conform or can not weaponize without revealing themselves 
- It is the business of institutions to themselves if NOPSEC is rubbish and OPSEC is life, then why are you not spying on which ever institution are spying to find out just what you are dong with all that OPSEC?
- How is OPSEC for computers fun, its a hoop to jump through?
- Living by Moscow rules made some Cold War spies go absolutely mad 
- Be mindful of any control mechanism, because you are operating without the filters of OPSEC  
- You are the patterns of life, patterns are enumeratable, why not have positive value adding patterns that affect all areas of life
- OPSEC is continuous sacrifice in silent acceptance that you can only operate as a group maybe for some time, not a net positive. 
- OPSEC is embodiment of dispowerment - if you can not openly do something are you really powerful?
- If you are not paranoid then you are not vigilant enough about the underlying tools you are using that *must be secure, because OPSEC* - you are asserted that the cat is a live and well in the box in a Schrodinger's Cat scenario

#### Examples of NOPSEC

Where the may have been a smidgen of OPSEC, from the microscopic to massive 

- Tuberculous is parasite of the immune system, using the macrophages modify it to be a host to then propagate slowly enough to avoid macrophage against macrophage. When a host macrophage is expended it burst, your cells then contain the macrophage host together in a clump creating a granuloma for more replication. If you immune system is not strong enough the granuloma bursts causing flooding of the lungs to ensure external propagation thorough fluids expelled. Immune system then cause lots of damage to your body as a response to attempt eradicate Tuberculous.

> Researching this:
- Colonies of Ants do not use OPSEC - information is used to control network where each ant is very simple and can do simple tasks, but together operate in a very complex way: farming plants with other insects, creating floating structures from there connected bodies to protect against high water levels,

- Honey Badger  - tough, strong immune system with hardest working liver in the galaxy morty, can take risks, weaponize sent warfare, can use tools and repurpose objects, persistence.

- Stone fish, Cone Snail, Angel Shark for the OPSEC

- Russia acknowledging Trump, won Trump the election, not any hacking - ordinary non-technical people see a person knows another like they speak with their neighbour. To the ordinary person Trump could just smooth over a issue with Putin. Similarly with North Korea years later, polls went through the roof. 
- Boris Johnson misuse of words deliberately as signalling strategy to indicate something being somehow wrong, because he said incorrectly *vEEgan sausage rolls*
- Find - Chinese General sat on the top of the fort with less than 1000 men besieged by many tens of the thousand and because of NOPSEC of exuding true self on the information it prevent further siege, because the sieging army retreating thinking it was a trap. 
- All Propaganda wants to be NOPSEC
- Jason Street exists awesomely and does great talks and work.
- Everything Alister Crowley did without being incarcerated once.
