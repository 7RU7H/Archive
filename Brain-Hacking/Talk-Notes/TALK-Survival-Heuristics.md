# Survival Heuristics: My Favorite Techniques for Avoiding Intelligence Traps - SANS CTI Summit 2018

These are the TL;DWatch notes and takeways from the excellent talk: [Survival Heuristics: My Favorite Techniques for Avoiding Intelligence Traps - SANS CTI Summit 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNv2PlqmsAc) avaliable for free on Youtube. I came across this talk well over a year ago and decided to consider comparivity practicing amateurly everyday what was discussed in this talk, also to see I missed anything and have written record of the important points. The description reads: *In a 32-year plus career in the Intelligence Community, Carmen Medina made many different types of intelligence mistakes and suffered the consequences of faulty thinking. But along the way she learned a thing or two, and she is now eager to share these learnings with other intelligence professionals. In an entertaining and practical talk, she will share her favorite shortcuts and intelligence process hacks to help analysts think better and communicate their findings more effectively to their clients. Carmen Medina, Retired, CIA; Author, Rebels At Work: A Handbook for Leading Change from Within*

## Traps to Avoid

- **Avoid the streetlight effect**
	- Be humble about the decisions you make about:
	- Information accuracy 
	- Current level of knowledge
	- You are biased
	- Your perspective is (flawed) slice of collective consensus reality and abstract **entirely unknowable** universal reality
	- Comparison to the estimatable potential reality
	- Excessive comparison to the abstract **entirely unknowable** universal actuality 
- **Trends are Always about past!**
	- Do not depend on trends
	- Cause in terms of probability does not really affect the subsequent output
	- Observe and analyse the small indicators of change
	- Observe the present very careful
	- Non-obvious indicators of whatever phenomenon, continues to link to larger phenomena you are observing  
- **Most Things Don't Happen by Chance**
	- Random cluster exists, but is clusters are still patterns
	- "*Chance*" must be exchange for phase for "I do not understand the causality chain"
	- Respect Exponential Causality and it is related to exponential functions
	- Linear thinking, does not factor the multiplicity of causality links from one point.
- **Worst Case Scenarios Happen**
	- Worst case actually happen conflated it with unlikely and not impossible
	- Probability of something occurring is independent from the consequences to that event may have
- **When You're Explaining You're Losing**
	- Act of explaining is counter-productive, especially in argument 
	- Compelling examples and stories are better, rather than rely only on technical explanation
- **You Never Run out of Bullets**
	- Linear thinking does not account for some *"accountables"*
	- Life happens, stuff happens people will keep going however
- **Emotions can Kill**
	- Humans are emotional, analysts may underestimate the the emotional motivation of actors in events
	- Information has emotional resonance
	- (Mine) Take your emotions out of it

## Strategies

- **Construct and Revise Analytic Landscape**
	Rules:
	- Consult outsiders
	- Present it graphically - no text
	Point:
	- Captures a reality about the target of analysis
	- Forces think about every aspect
	- Tool for shift attention
- **Apply Category System**
	- Apply a Category System
		- Example: CYNEFIN Framework
		- Complex `(CE)` (Patterns) **probe**, sense respond | Complicated (Analysis, Experts) sense, **analyse** respond | Chaotic `C!=E` (No patterns) **act**, sense, respond | Simple `C==E` (best practice, SOPs) sense, **categorise**, respond
- **Know Your Thinking Style**
	- There is not a good test
	- Simple things still apply: Optimist or Pessimist
	- Gregorc thinking inventory: Abstract or Concrete, Random or Sequential
- **Find a Thinking Partner**
	- Explore ideas with others
	- Do not ignore the analogue techniques: Take a walk with your thinking partner
- **Deploy Diversity of Thought**
		- Free flowing debate is best, allow dissent to be wrong
			- Will lead to better outcomes.
		- Managing differences of opinion is very difficult 
			- Conducting management affects this:
				- 10 minute meeting = must be important for diversity of thought to occur
- **Think together from the start**
	- Collaborate from the start 
	- Otherwise you are de-conflicting 
	- Especially with Diversity of Thought
- **Respect your Intuition**
	- Your brain is always operation, it can reveal it to your consciousness
	- Author notes: Brain has to actually do what she is deciding to work in the first place...
