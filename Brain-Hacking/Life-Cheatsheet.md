# Life

0. Breath and relax: assess how you feel, if you are stressed or sad those need to be fixed (you can't learn or work more effectively), but throw yourself into your work and carry on the patterns regardless of what happens
0. Get good sleep - see 0, 1 add them together (place to sleep and excise)
0. Separation of location:
  - Brain associates a place with an activity - do not mix them
1. Excise Everyday
  - 15% Learning Uptake from endorphins; if you did something that made you learn 15% less you would not do it!
2. Reward patterns of behaviour that you want to add, the bad will become unnecessary 
3. Eat Healthily
4. Novelty (especial if it is objective adjacent )equates to lots of dopamine and your brain not getting lazy
5. Study and Learn effectively
6. Always make time for family or they will charge you the interest on that debt of time just because want to make time for you (if you do not have a family or do not have functioning family relations get help fixing them)
7. Schedule your day, but count out how much you can do. Focus is muscle it takes time to focus, do not Pomodoro method - remove distractions (if you cant finish it reflect on why)
8. At the end of each day remember what you learnt
9. Some problems are difficult - walking around enough may help, but some require other people
10. The only failure is to not learn some what you have done during the day - redefine success and failure - DO THE WORK, regardless of outcome enjoy other success and assimilate it into your method
  - If you solve a programming challenge, Crackme, CTFs, etc: Always learn how someone did it or something differently, better or their thought process
