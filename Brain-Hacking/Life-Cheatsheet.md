-2 Breath and relax: assess how you feel, if you are stressed or sad those need to be fixed (you can't learn or work more affectively), but throw yourself into your work and carry on the patterns regardless of what happens

0. Seperation of location:
  - Brain associates a place with an activity - do not mix them
1. Execise Everyday

2. Reward patterns of behaviour that you want to add, the bad will become unnessarisary 
3. Eat Healthily
4. Novelty (especial if it is objective adjecent )equates to lots of dopamine and your brain not getting lazy
5. Study and Learn affectively
6. Always make time for family or they will charge you the interest on that debt of time just because want to make time for you (if you do not have a family or do not have functioning family relations get help fixing them)
7. Schedule your day, but count out how much you can do. Focus is muscle it takes time to focus, do not Poro domo method - remove distractions (if you cant finish it reflect on why)
8. At the end of each day remember what you learnt
