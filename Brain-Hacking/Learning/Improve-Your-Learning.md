# Learning

This basically hack together and I think a better way to teach how to learn more effetively than [Justin Sung](https://www.youtube.com/c/JustinSung) as really the key to all learning is a compression and hyper-connectively. This a more effective way as to memorise this simple short sentence per-concept manual. 

Objectives:
1. Improve the quality of information we take in
2.Improve the way or mode in which we receive information
3. Improve our practice of retrieving information
4. Improve upon self-discipline and methodology of self-critique to find flaws and schedule a solution to improve on that flaw  

Concepts:
- Cognative Load - Too much information at once
- [Contextualised Learning](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED448304.pdf) - it is easier to learn something if you are contextualising it with practice
- [Transversal Skills Lopez and Rodriguez-Lopez, 2020)](https://ervet-journal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40461-020-00100-0](https://ervet-journal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40461-020-00100-0) 
	- Focus on understanding:
		- Methodology
		- Techniques
		- Purpose of actions
- Demonstrative Method - modelling what is intended to be learnt 
	- Re-enforce verification of our work - Science!  
- [Interleaving](https://academicaffairs.arizona.edu/l2l-strategy-interleaving) - learning in context one task to for example exploit a system may actually help one understand how to detect it
- Priming - briefing your brain with information of something that is upcoming have memories to reference and instantiate 
- Modelling - map out material to be learnt in model of context


TL;DR - TODOs

- Check you understood what you read
	- [[Improve-Reading]]
- Improve Critical Thinking 
	- [(Daniel, Lafortune, Pallascio, et al., 2005)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marie-france_Daniel/publication/262849880_Modeling_the_Development_Process_of_Dialogical_Critical_Thinking_in_Pupils_Aged_10_to_12_Years/links/54ee0f110cf25238f93984dd.pdf) 
- Create a model what you are learn
	- [(Intel, 2012)](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/program/education/us/en/documents/project-design/strategies/instructionalstrategies-modeling.pdf) 
- Ask yourself am I learning anything doing X, but also explore and experiment with cross-domain ideas; fixation on single disciplines (i.e. in Music:
	- Music is divided into roles based on the ranges of pitch, but if you only fixate one range you do not appreciate what each instrument at each range accomplishes 
- Practice the 4 types of learning with respect to complexity of the topic, port number need repetition - AD exploitation requires graphing
- Exercise: Increase your ability to take in new information, by chemical hacking your brain to learning 15% more effectively (also improves mental health, sleep schedules - the first thing a mental health profession will check if you are ill or heading toward being unwell is how much exercise you do). 
	- [(Warner, 2006)](https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20061103/exercise-fights-fatigue-boosts-energy) - Exercise improves almost everything
	- [(Rodriguez, 2015)](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hit-the-gym-after-studying-to-boost-recall/) - Exercise after study to boost recall
- One to four hours a day is better than 15 hours a day, but if you want to work alot then pivot and manage deep and shallower work intervals 
- Sleep is important for learning - [(Sandoiu, 2018)](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321161) , [(Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2019)](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/10/191001083956.htm) 
- Learn by doing, remember by doing
	- i.e. in Music: Learn all the theory, but never practice with instrument make your composition unnatural (the physical actualities of your limbs or organ when playing have to inform a composition); it is common for composers to hand over alot of interpretation and control to the player.
- Listen to listen, don't listen to respond
- Be humble - masters are always humble as they understand there is always something still to humble them
- Try to the least smart person in the room surrounded by smarter people.
- Challenge yourself
	- Embrace challenge and push yourself
- Follow and practice with a master 
	- Be kind as challenge is not a kindness
	- Other often have better and, more importantly different ideas and methods 
- Pick a good place to learn
	- Sniper condition train helps Snipers improve under different stress conditions, but
	- The same place to do X is part of informing your brain that you in a place where you do X 
		- Do not work from bed, bed is to sleep.
- Schedule time to experiment and improvise
	- Experiment-and-experiment-again mindset ensures you trying different combinations and understand a further completeness of a unit of something.
- Good Note taking, Flashcards, etc are subjectively made, but quality is empirical
- Retrieval Practice 
	- Recall practice
	- Before reaching for solution in notes or online - STOP and try and make your brain remember or solve it first, then look if you cant remember AND to check if you are correct
	- Gentle remind yourself everything you have learnt before Sleep
- Spaced Learning - [(Pan, 2022)](https://psychology.ucsd.edu/undergraduate-program/undergraduate-resources/academic-writing-resources/effective-studying/spaced-practice.html)
	- Theory and Practice balanced to task
	- Spread out deep study sessions 
	- Exercise for 15% for 2 hours ~ 
	- After 4 hours brief break - must lie down and close eyes to rest!
- SQ3R and PQ4R methods 
	- Survey, question, read, recite and review
	- Preview, question, read, reflect, recite and review - [good for reading comprehension](https://www.verywellfamily.com/strategy-improves-reading-comprehension-2162266)
- Feynman Technique 
	1.  Learn a X
	2.  Explain it to a beginner
	3.  Identify gaps
	4.  Return to study

This will not make a genius in a week or a month, but will make a better student and teacher over the course months. It is a investment that will last a lifetime. But with that stated you must **PRACTICE IT**, like incident response you must actually try to respond to the incident in the first place otherwise you have failed.

## Attention

Dual Coding - Multiple modes of the same or similar information used to learn a single unit what is to be learnt - [Cuevas, 2014](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/brain-based-learning-myth-versus-reality-testing-learning-styles-and-dual-coding/)


## Time Investment 

- Increase Cognitive Load - Do not use the 25 mins work 5 mins break method
	- Have deep and shallow Work sections 
	- Interweave Practice and Theory 
		- Read a Page, find the important parts if you do not remember them then improve you cognitive load on reading to finding those parts again and re-read
- Critical Reflection of technique, what do and what does not work
	- Separate an amount time to recall after Deep and Shallow type of application of learning.
- Learning Objectives
	- What level of learning I am practising?
	- Pre study to figure out the relationships, but delay note taking
	- After priming an understand solidification concept by concept by laying and spreading out over time the concepts that are relevant to the overall learning plan over a long period of time being generous in how stupid you actually are and not too tight in time scheduling.

## How we fundamentally remember

Symbiotic relationship of **Encoding** memories and **Recalling**. Remain calm and remember you will forget things and that is OK. The important information is the you schedule a set amount of time to understand what it relevant to you given your objective of what you must/want to learn. Encoding is linearly following the day to day doing of the tasks to learn. The old *insert social media or old media format* of telling to just do the stuff. Be kind to yourself allow yourself time to fail and remember everyone starts somewhere and that in utero, we all start off growing from arsehole. Just do not be a arsehole to others or yourself. Recall the things that matter and getting stressed by what does and does not matter is just you being a silly arsehole trying to grow. Growing is always painful, take it slow and then speed it up. Start somewhere and start at some point, but make time to remember to remember the good things you did to achieve your objectives. Even if it was a bad day, you took 30 minutes to read or watch something about the thing you wanted to do or learn to then do more of it. No person has infinite time to remember to to encode everything do not worry.   

## Learning Typology 

My simplified | Explanation | Sung's Terms | Ascii Art Figure references
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Repetition** | Doing something that is of a domain you want to learn | Isolation | Figure 1 
**Practice** | Applying/Gaining understanding by perform action relative to the domain | Applied / Related | Figure 2 
**Mapping** | Drawing connection with what notetaking device mapping the domain of information, asking you brain how is objects in this domain connected | Relationships / Groups | Figure 3
**Graphing** | With map of a domain of connection, add logic, maths, metainformation, heirarchies, prioritisation, etc | Judgement / prioritisation | Figure 4

    [IDEA d] <- [IDEA c]

```


## Additional 

- **Priming** - Before learning a concept do shallow research of the topic for a short time, then take break to try to connect everything - THEN watch/attend video lecture, conference do the lab, etc - Taking notes to reconnect everything in a more "Correct" way from you shallow research.

Priming is Psycholinguistics term to describe in modern colloqial termed a "triggering", in the context of learning we are gaining a brief overview with the need to understand in any meaningful extent. 

- [[Black-Box-Method]], Black-Boxing a concept or problem.

- **Feynmanesque Teaching It to Compress it**

Teaching the domain of information you have somewhat learnt helps by using recall and deliberately trying to compress the information to explain it to someone else or through a medium like text or video.  You strengthen connection while re-encoding a more compressed version of what was learnt.

- **Spacing**

Spacing 

## My take - Pivoting, Globalising and Allowing for mundane tasking

I personally do not avocate spacing, I say pivoting is better if you globalise the domain you want to learn to **AS MANY** areas and aspect of your life. Whether its thinking about an RFC while having sex to not DoS yourself, leaving the only thing to pick up a book about x86 instructions or to when sad, tired, imposter-syndromed-out-the-wazzo do a code along about rest API design or hack along for CTF, Vulnerable machine or Bug Bounty Program.

If all there is only classical music triangles, theory about playing the triangle and it in the context of classical music, triangle social media... and that is all there is because you want that to be that way you are not going to get rid of any the stuff mentioned and probably going to get good at playing the triangle and understanding the triangles role in classical music.  

If you hitting walls move on a doing something easier, but always similar.

Building things: make an AD lab, a website, etc - if you can build them you can break into them or harden them.

Put books in the toilet to read, if was a instrument carry or have smaller instrument to play, leave what you need to learn everywhere or take it with you. 

Play the instrument in front the television, play the jingles, practice holding or playing ostentation, but for hacking related - have an account for only hacking related medium stuff and prioritise going to this account over any others. 

Be mentored, follow along with a YouTube or streamer, get you hands on the keyboard and be mentored for almost free.
