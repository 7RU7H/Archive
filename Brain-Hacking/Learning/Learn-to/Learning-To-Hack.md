By 7ru7h therefore as always look at other sources, it is just good for being a researcher or hacker or whatever

Warning does contain enjoy the spicey takes, like programming and CTF vs Bug hunting
There are alot of these how to learn to x so firstly address the learning part:


Hacker mindset is commonly refered to. In priority order it really begins and dies on:

It is skill set that is built over years of time, orangutan can use tools, script kiddies can press a button, but the real awesomeness of Hacking is almost not even really the hacking:
- How does a system work - range of abstraction of how?  
- Building, maintaining and troubleshooting systems to a **modern** standard 


1. Understand it, by asking questions and researching how something works - an activity to acquire knowledge
	- Knowing a lot - Or rephrase that to think in a manner that is set of continual future pattern of trying to understand a concept
	- Subverting the system - Re-purposing a system, to think of it as subversion leads to non-encompassing understanding - to re-purpose requires understanding of the actualities of the system's intended and unintended occur actualities when interacted with.
1. Patience and Focus 
	- the Pomodoro Method is evil - **DO NOT TAKE BREAKS EVERY 25 minutes**
		- Push to hour, remembering to exercise 15% Learning Uptake and posture health - sitting is bad. 
	- If you have neither do it or something for fun or make it more fun with other through social or following allow with a streamer, class, course, Youtube, etc 
	- and because you enjoy it - both patience and focus are hard earnt qualities to fight for everyday
	- Remove distractions, habits that create distraction 
3. Organisation and Mental logistics and the Tao of testing
	- Be methodically and scientific - measure twice cut once
	- If your data is a mess how are you going to connect that data to find the way 
	- If you have the infrastructure to replicate the target, you do not get into the Schr√∂dinger's Hack of whether interaction (successful, erroneous, destructive) or lack of interaction, **which may then affect later interactions thereby failing yourself by not be organised and methodical**   
4. Creativity in connecting data to be combined into doing - an activity to separate the useful information and connecting it together
5. Tool are extensions of **your** [[Question-Based-Penetration-Testing-Methodology]] (you have to make and practice and revise **your capabilities**)


4. Train your brain to love solving problems. Hacking is problem solving a task with the payoff that often a takes long time to get to. 
	- Learn Go and try make very small programs 
		- Delay googling solutions - set timer & amount of actions you have till you can look up
		- Do not use some the standard library sometimes
		- Do not use other people imports at first
		- Look up the python/ruby solution and translate it - learn them at the same time while build multi-lingualism and deepen your golang understand
		- Look the best golang solution after you succeeded or failed to improve your own code. Code review without the egos and your code gets better for free.
	1. Learn efficiently  
		- Space it out, interweave practice with reading, deep study and shallow study
5. Do sometime new and related everyday
6. If cant explain the x to the most non technical person, will management understand, do you actually understand it? - It is a good concept comprehension test and good for memory compression and neural strengthening.
7. Read a little every day, but diversify - You read scans, terminals, code everyday - insert Tyrion Lannister quote about reading - but learn to REALLY read - Fast and slow reading - when to to go fast and when to go slow:
	 - i.e Bug Bounty report one day, AD whitepaper another or insert-x-ethical-hacking-x-site reading material; Blog about CVEs; Proof of Concepts about bugs; Source Code.
8. Take Notes and visualise the problems
9. Develop humility, integrity and remember you are stupid. The training your brain to like solving the problem and the feeling when it works over time train a patience for long complex tasks or researching that can get very frustrating.
10. Learn, practice and research whatever **you** are interested in and enjoy, not what is cool or apparently makes money quick a better investment is alway go for long term expertise, the always money comes after.
11. Explore in different ways
	-  [Have Gzegroz Niedziela explain some mad real world Web Exploits](https://www.youtube.com/c/BugBountyReportsExplained) 
	- Be handheld through an insane machine to know how far I many connections in my brain I have to go - roughly scaled between scarily alot and ton
		- Reasoning comes from being good guitar: do it for the sounds that you could make not to look cool; more sounds you can make the more musical intense you can make anything. Sometimes you just to sit there and be wowed and try anyway, clumsy try - be humble - find the parts that are difficult and find similarly easier elements elsewhere, [More Rocky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHpFSQMUxj4), [More Cheesey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGZsnbPCv1I) or [More British](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-Yc2rzOOM) or [Wooten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFcPlv9RhEY) or more [Bass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa0upTDZDYQ) or [Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIKWBdthzg4) - combine all of that and keep building
	- Get the bigger the picture of whatever sometimes. [Like Haddix Application Analysis Methodology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnSAa2KmBI)  

Some of the below can be connective - i.e 

- Don't worry about learning everything, but dont specialise, wait years before really making that decision. everything is connect dont limit yourself.
- Read and Practice -(In order of expense) Tryhackme, Pentester Labs, Hack The Box Acamedy
	- It should be more hands on keyboard and less reading until you need to read to solve a problem. 
- Go beyond root - Performing Sysadmin tasks -, Persistence, Research service configurations, do cleanup, Alternate Routes - alternate vulnerablities, no metasploit, only [[Windows-Living-Off-The-Land]], find the check in the script used to find the PrivEsc vector... 
- Watch and note Ippsec, X Youtube
	- Also sit down and be passive mentored through a box sometimes. Why?
		- Firstly life is chaotic, sometimes you have bad days, but to do sometime you love every day on those bad days: get hands on keyboard and watching copy the Youtuber. Its like a free in person training and mentoring - it is how complex animals learn, think monkeys and nut and rocks lined up together.
	- But also apply as stated about learning to code to this. Be honest you are not going to do X box in this amount of time if it is challenge, but pace the help - Proving grounds requires a certian amount of time before giving you access to walkthroughs
	- **BUT** Read the walkthroughes afterwards anyway if you succeed. 0xDF is good choice for Hack the box - some boxes have multiple paths intended or otherwise
	- **BUT** more importantly you need to have a solution
		- If you just got the answer from the teacher in a maths class you would really learn maths
		- If you never got help from a teacher then you never learn some the assumptions and shortcut pieces of information that required for more complex thinking surrounding problems. Also there is assumptive most efficient way to do almost everything - you need these to solve more problems more quickly - it'll also make it more fun.
- Read/Watch everyone else: 0xdf, snowscan, etc 
- Start noting what you do, your brain is a finite size
- Learn Google Dorking - [[Search-Engine-Dorking]]
	- Better queries mean better results 
- Social Network 
	- Try to be the least smart person in a room whenever possible - or remember you are almost certainly the least smart person in rooms full smart people.
	- Talk less, be polite and be friendly to social and cultural norms
		- Our brains are story driven - and stories like
			- You: *"Hello, how does x 0day work?"* does not work they are not google or your teacher.
	- Listen more (rough 80/20 ratio) and ask good questions 
	- Find friends to do stuff 
		- Discord apparently 
		- Meet people in the real world - if you can
		- Avoid the Dark Web
			- To me it seems like the adult equivalent of a child going to place were told not to go for just a second and running away.
			- And if you stay.. you are just another idiot for whatever scam - Governmental backed, Criminally Backed, etc... why even bother it their to trap both and idiots in the Great Games that Money-Ideological-Coercion-Ego games that people play on themselves and others play on them - and you will never be one of them, no matter how high up or cyber-firepower you bring in you are Government Agency, Hactivist Group or Criminal Gang you are it is Game as Old as time itself. 
			- Also if you learning or working in there even if you save the world like Marcus Hutchins, you are still targetable by law enforcement somewhere.
	- For me finding other people was the hardest as I am a people person in a digitally socialising world. I could talk my way into a bank vault and back out again, but never into good company to learn this stuff - hopeful this will change.
- Learn Networking and Web - Network+
	- Wireshark - Tryhackme, Pentester Lab
	- Burpsuite - Tryhackme, Pentester Lab
	- Network Virtualised machines
- Learn to script 
	- Try a bash and powershell command during your day
	- Piece these together into a script for later automation - build it up, thank me later!
- Learn Go and Python/Ruby - Learn Go before Python it is ACTUALLY easier in the long term. Also in my oppinion Python is too far abstractly from the Logic that is worth the practice and learning. 
	- Go is the fastest way to train your brain to enjoying hard problems without  the issue of compilers, debugging, memory management, compatibility, dependency problem
	- Go teaches Style and its Readability
	- Most say you do not need to be able to program, programming is problem solving
	- All you need is [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/) and [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/), dont worry about compilers or anything else. 
	- Go is easy to pick up and has all the best older languages of Java, Javascript, C, Python. Then you can learn these without the learn curves OR the stablity issues 
	- Python/Ruby scripting is everywhere pick one - Both have vast issues, like everything
- Learn Operating Systems and System Administration
- Build Virtual Machines and more importantly network them
- CTFs - (In no particular order) Tryhackme, HackTheBox, Proving Grounds, Pentester Labs
	- Some are not real world enough - To puzzle orientated, but sometimes default passwords are actually used in the real world...	
- Bug Bounty, but... *"instead look for vulnerabilities passively"* - Peter Kim and instead MUST  peoples research even if you do not actually want to do web pentesting or bug bounty. 
- It is trendy - ALWAYS avoid - and very poor work (also lot of wasted time) to pay ratio
	- Problem is there is little to no feedback loop if you do not have fundamentals
	- Requires a level of capability to really start that takes years
	- Then you are up against automation and experience Bug Hunters
	- Partner Programs are a barrier for a reason
- Build your own methodology and intuitions, but remember their are much better resources for good reason - I think that about this repository comparative to others, it helps. 
- Do the coursework don't do the exam, but **do** go for the exam if need some goal or certificate is what you want. Expertise comes from experience, but the measure of experience is demonstrable work **complete** and a certificate is measure of work done at particular standard. Experience of a certain quality is what is sort after.


Disclaimer Writeups to me are legitimate self solving of machines, but I think personally everyone should write and ethically hack for a variety of reasons. Secondly it really not healthy to learn hacking in a way that makes failure a part of it. You won't actually learn that way, it is an elitist and gate-keeping mindset towards anything. The best in the world in any domain are the best out learning and enjoying the process. A culture of *"cards close to  the chest"* mentality about one's capability to towards doing the the thing and making content for yourself to document your progress is madness, cowardice and only an Ethical Hacking community problem. Artists of all kind would never improve, Competivity Sports person, Programming and Video Gamers STEM field would never public verify anything and this were this just about money, jobs and ego. Nothing more. It would be absurd for a most other professions to treat the activity they do this way. Just say you looked a writeup, then you know what you do not know otherwise enjoy the 1984 madness of everyone else and burnout. Also there so many boxes to do them all solo would take a long time. I personally want to complete HTB and THM, but not waste years of my life malding into the abyss, because of culture or tradition.

As of 2023 I have got a formula for Helped-Throughs, after much testing and realised that Helped-Throughs should either be:

Personal Requirements: 
1. Balance in all things. Do not do just one or the other, if you must lean more to doing Writeups especially the more experienced you are. 
1. Writeups are not Helped-Throughouts 
	- Writeup are solo or team solving of a CTF
	- Help-Throughout are way to remove most of the challenge to encourage experimentation, research, in depth focus, positivity in succeeding to learn not learning out of the pain failure

Benefits:
1. Note taking the process
2. Writing will improve your weaknesses and flaws through discovery of them
3. A better way to enjoy and important learn content creator and expose all the other great hackers out there.
	-  Watching the video without try what is happening is good, but as good as personally practical experiences
4. Have a better learning curve expand research and understand without claiming to be awesome
5. Beat the imposter syndrome, by make it about learning not fail, but do not mix challenge - but do challenging content without help

Types:
1. Stop and Start; Push till stuck - 2 hours max **and then** - walk it out then try again for another 30 minutes, then stop and peak. And only peak.
	1. Beyond root should be box related and one or two tasks that take a maximum of 1 hour each 
	2. After completion you must review at least three writeups both video and written of the diagic learning
2. Like a full project - like (must be) extensive walkthrough or bootcamp in you favourite location:
	- Multiple Writeups both video and written
	- One section must be challenge to try without support in an area of weakness - 1 hour maximum
	- It must document what you have learnt about your weaknesses and mistakes 
	- It must takes at atleast 12 hours on one machine and its topics
	- Research of surrounding relevant information must occur at depth
	- Beyond root should be extensive
