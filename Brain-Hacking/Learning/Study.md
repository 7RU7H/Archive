#### Focus 

- Pomdoro Method does not work in a world were every person, group, corporation, government, etc wants you attention and most profit from taking it.
- Expand your attention, by rewarding incrementally, prolonging that reward to master focus. Mastering focus and its retention is excise that requires time focusing; **Authors stipulations: TLDR I have yet to figure out a best amount**: i.e sometimes its more about knowing when to walk away from a problem and wait - sometimes its better to continue on (it is really difficult to tell its like the Turing Complete problem for Learning, but every variable which are using to monitor changes...). 

#### Building Muscle and Power

[YouTube Crystal Clear Mathematics - How to Build Mathematical 'Muscle and Power'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvEHcsfkDX4) Description: *If you have been following this video series, you should now have an effective study system/structure in place and an understanding of how your memory works, good study attitudes, a good working environment, and an established daily routine. But what do you actually do when you sit down to study mathematics? There are four ways in which you can study mathematics and this video describes the fourth method: seeking out challenging and very difficult problems to develop superior mathematical 'muscle,' finesse and expertise.*

Define rules about how you should study to [[Avoiding-Examination-Errors]] (contains information from Crystal Clear Mathematics), to learn and understand:
- Fact ~ Summary - extract and organise; your brain and the experiences in your life are yours and you need to organise them yourself to what is meaningful and understandable to you
- Skills ~ Drill Work - Skills that demonstrate understanding of the syllabus
- Errors (Develop Habits) [[Avoiding-Examination-Errors]].
	- Excise around and in learning (~15% uptake increase over time is massive) 
	- Place, Psyche, Purpose (informed by the anything below)
	- Routine
	- Rigour in how you do activities you will be examined on
	- Recite the required (factoid in conceptually motivated learning), found in practice by practising
	- Reading fast and slow, extracting and application (test the extracted), testing and teaching
- Finesse  
	- Think mathematical - apply mathematics to everyday and where you can
	- Seek out challenges with difficult questions

#### Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart - Notes

[YouTube Marty Lobdell - Study Less Study Smart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlU-zDU6aQ0) Description: *If you spend hours and hours of studying, without improving your grades, or information retention, then learn how to study smart by Marty Lobdell. Lobdell taught Psychology at Pierce College in Washington State for 40 years. During Lobdell's career, he has taught tens of thousands of students and he wants students to succeed. After watching students cram for eight hours or more for a test without any improvement, Lobdell has developed a studying technique that helps the brain retain the information that you are studying in this video "Study Less, Study Smart"*

Estimate the typical college freshman can read material in their book or in their notes and effectively learn what they're reading?
- Study: 25 minutes attention span, study more can actually worsen performance (this is the starting point)
- Rule as soon as you start to slide you are shovelling against the tide - take a break
- Reward the good, punish or ignore the bad
- State dependent memory 
- Train yourself to study longer
- Study at a place of study
- To be a true learning experience you have to behaviour differently
- More active learning the better
	- Are you learning Concept or Fact
	- If you cannot put the concept in your own words you do not understand it
- Notes are to help you remember - reread your notes and expand on everything
- Thought excises about value of use of what you are learning
- Meaning piece is a piece that relates to a piece you already know
- Study groups
- Recognition is not remembering - highlighting is bad
- Sleep better to remember more
- If you are going quizzes go forward the next question, re-answer the previous question in your own words
- Sacrifice time to study 
- Ask more questions
- Teach other people what you are learning - talking to empty chairs OK
- SQ3R - Survey, Question, Read, Recite and Review
	- If you intending to find something in text you will find it
- Study early
- Mnemonics 
	- Acronyms
	- Coined Sayings
	- Interacting Images

- Practice focus
- Pre-Study and Priming
- Use Analogues 
- Limitation of Mnemonics: Information is isolated and like a checklist
