[YouTube Crystal Clear Maths - How to Avoid Making Careless Errors in Exams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vmp2FAtHMrg) Description: *If you have been following this video series, you should now have an effective study system/structure in place and an understanding of how your memory works, good study attitudes, a good working environment, and an established daily routine. But what do you actually do when you sit down to study mathematics? There are four ways in which you can study mathematics and this video describes the third method: refining your habits (setting out or work and working procedures) to minimise your risk of making careless errors.*

Develop Habits to Avoid Errors:
- Study errors in your exam papers
	- Look for your own carelessness
	- Careless is a sizeable percentage of incorrect answers
- Think of habits to avoid those errors
	- Draw bigger diagrams (or in different locations) - Workspace mobility 
	- Complete each action - Order of Operations
	- Don't do so much in your head - Noting 
	- Use headings and set your work out clearly - Noting 
	- Write formulae before substituting - Order of Operations
	- Re-read questions after you have answered them - Locate the obvious mistakes
	- Solve some problems in one big equation - Start with everything - miss nothing
- Develop procedural habits for answering questions
- Practise your improved habits until they are ingrained
