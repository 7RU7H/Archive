# Power Thorough Learning


- Respect the pedagogical Tao
- Teaching and Learning have all the trappings of trade
- The only success is to learn from others
- Reading is part of healthy learning diet, but if keep reading you will never remember what you read like a RAM of a typewriter. 
- Practice refines, but you never imagine anything differently, hypothesise and learn from other
- Building in any direction will at some point happen a upon a point where you forget why and what the purpose of building in the first place
- Designing leads to endless design, but you never make anything
- Be both iconoclastic and reverent of icons; dissect to find the components, rebuild ideas like Lego to understand, curate to compare and retain form and formlessness and the process in between
