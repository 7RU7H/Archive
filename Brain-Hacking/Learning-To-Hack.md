By 7ru7h therefore as always look at other sources, it is just good for being a researcher or hacker or whatever

Warning does contain enjoy the spicey takes, like programming and CTF vs Bug hunting
There are alot of these how to learn to x so firstly address the learning part:

1. Train your brain to love solving problems. Hacking is problem solving a task with the payoff that often a takes long time to get to. 
	- Learn Go and try make very small programs 
		- Delay googling solutions - set timer & amount of actions you have till you can look up
		- Do not use some the standard libary sometimes
		- Do not use other people imports at first
		- Look up the python/ruby solution and translate it - learn them at the same time while build multi-lingualism and deepen your golang understand
		- Look the best golang solution after you succeeded or failed to improve your own code. Code review without the egos and your code gets better for free.
	1. Learn efficiently  
		- Space it out, interweave practice with reading, deep study and shallow study
1. Do sometime new and related everyday
2. Read a little every day, but diversify - You read scans, terminals, code everyday - insert  Tyrion Lannister quote about reading - but learn to REALLY read - Fast and slow reading - when to to go fast and when to go slow:
	 - i.e Bug Bounty report one day, AD whitepaper another or insert-x-ethical-hacking-x-site reading material; Blog about CVEs; Proof of Concepts about bugs; Source Code.
1. Take Notes and visualise the problems
4. Develop humility, integrity and remember you are stupid. The training your brain to like solving the problem and the feeling when it works over time train a patience for long complex tasks or researching that can get very frustrating.
5. Learn, practice and research whatever **you** are interested in and enjoy, not what is cool or apparently makes money quick a better investment is alway go for long term expertise, the always money comes after.
6. Explore in different ways
	-  [Have Gzegroz Niedziela explain some mad real world Web Exploits](https://www.youtube.com/c/BugBountyReportsExplained) 
	- Be handheld through an insane machine to know how far I many connections in my brain I have to go - roughly scaled between scarily alot and ton
		- Reasoning comes from being good guitar: do it for the sounds that you could make not to look cool; more sounds you can make the more musical intense you can make anything. Sometimes you just to sit there and be wowed and try anyway, clumsy try - be humble - find the parts that are difficult and find similarly easiler elements elsewhere, [More Rocky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHpFSQMUxj4), [More Cheesey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGZsnbPCv1I) or [More British](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt-Yc2rzOOM) or [Wooten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFcPlv9RhEY) or more [Bass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sa0upTDZDYQ) or [Spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIKWBdthzg4) - combine all of that and keep building
	- Get the bigger the picture of whatever sometimes. [Like Haddix Application Analysis Methodology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqnSAa2KmBI)  

Some of the below can be connective - i.e 

- Don't worry about learning everything, but dont specialise, wait years before really making that decision. everything is connect dont limit yourself.
- Read and Practice -(In order of expense) Tryhackme, Pentester Labs, Hack The Box Acamedy
	- It should be more hands on keyboard and less reading until you need to read to solve a problem. 
- Watch and note Ippsec, X Youtube
	- Also sit down and be passive mentored through a box sometimes. Why?
		- Firstly life is chaotic, sometimes you have bad days, but to do sometime you love every day on those bad days: get hands on keyboard and watching copy the Youtuber. Its like a free in person training and mentoring - it is how complex animals learn, think monkeys and nut and rocks lined up together.
	- But also apply as stated about learning to code to this. Be honest you are not going to do X box in this amount of time if it is challenge, but pace the help - Proving grounds requires a certian amount of time before giving you access to walkthroughs
	- **BUT** Read the walkthroughes afterwards anyway if you succeed. 0xDF is good choice for Hack the box - some boxes have multiple paths intended or otherwise
	- **BUT** more importantly you need to have a solution
		- If you just got the answer from the teacher in a maths class you would really learn maths
		- If you never got help from a teacher then you never learn some the assumptions and shortcut pieces of information that required for more complex thinking surrounding problems. Also there is assumptive most effiecent way to do almost everything - you need these to solve more problems more quickly - it'll also make it more fun.
- Start noting what you do, your brain is a finite size
- Learn Google Dorking
	- Better queries mean better results 
- Social Network 
	- Try to be the least smart person in a room whenever possible - or remember you are almost certianly the least smart person in rooms full smart people.
	- Talk less, be polite and be friendly to social and cultural norms
		- Our brains are story driven - and stories like
			- You: *"Hello, how does x 0day work?"* does not work they are not google or your teacher.
	- Listen more (rough 80/20 ratio) and ask good questions 
	- Find friends to do stuff 
		- Discord apparently 
		- Meet people in the real world - if you can
		- Avoid the Dark Web
			- To me it seems like the adult equivilent of a child going to place were told not to go for just a second and running away.
			- And if you stay.. you are just another idiot for whatever scam - Governmental backed, Criminally Backed, etc... why even bother it their to trap both and idiots in the Great Games that Money-Ideological-Coercion-Ego games that people play on themselves and others play on them - and you will never be one of them, no matter how high up or cyber-firepower you bring in you are Government Agency, Hactivist Group or Criminal Gang you are it is Game as Old as time itself. 
			- Also if you learning or working in there even if you save the world like Marcus Hutchins, you are still targetable by law enforcement somewhere.
	- For me finding other people was the hardest as I am a people person in a digitally socializing world. I could talk my way into a bank vault and back out again, but never into good company to learn this stuff lol - hopeful this will change.
- Learn Networking and Web
	- Wireshark - Tryhackme, Pentester Lab
	- Burpsuite - Tryhackme, Pentester Lab
	- Network Virtualised machines
- Learn to script 
	- Try a bash and powershell command during your day
	- Piece these together into a script for later automation - build it up, thank me later!
- Learn Go and Python/Ruby - Learn Go before Python it is ACTUALLY easier in the long term. Also in my oppinion Python is too far abstractly from the Logic that is worth the practice and learning. 
	- Go is the fastest way to train your brain to enjoying hard problems without  the issue of compilers, debugging, memory management, compatibility, dependency problem
	- Go teaches Style and its Readability
	- Most say you do not need to be able to program, programming is problem solving
	- All you need is [Go Playground](https://go.dev/play/) and [Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/), dont worry about compilers or anything else. 
	- Go is easy to pick up and has all the best older languages of Java, Javascript, C, Python. Then you can learn these without the learn curves OR the stablity issues 
	- Python/Ruby scripting is everywhere pick one - Both have vast issues, like everything
- Learn Operating Systems and System Administration
- Build Virtual Machines and more importantly network them
- CTFs - (In no particular order) Tryhackme, HackTheBox, Proving Grounds, Pentester Labs
	- Some are not real world enough - To puzzle orientated, but sometimes default passwords are actually used in the real world...	
- Bug Bounty, but... *"instead look for vulnerablities passively"* - Peter Kim and instead MUST  peoples research even if you do not actually want to do web pentesting or bug bounty. 
- It is trendy - ALWAYS avoid - and very poor work (also lot of wasted time) to pay ratio
	- Problem is there is little to no feedback loop if you do not have fundementals
	- Requires a level of capability to really start that takes years
	- Then you are up against automation and experience Bug Hunters
	- Partner Programs are a barrier for a reason
- Build your own methodology and intuitions, but remember their are much betetr resources for good reason - I think that about this repository comparative to others, it helps. 
- Do the coursework dont do the exam, but **do** go for the exam if need some goal or certificate is what you want. Expertise comes from experience, but the measure of experience is demonstrable work **complete** and a certificate is measure of work done at particular standard. Experience of a certian quality is what is sort after.
