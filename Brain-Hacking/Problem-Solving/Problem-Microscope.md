# Problem Microscope

The Problem Microscope is a visual metaphor to apply the Problem Solving I made after many successes in Forensic and other CTFs. The premise being that a Problem has layers of which you are observing and sometimes you can miss things across `zooms` or layers of a Problem where the Problem is visualisable a thing in a dish. This model also tries to empathise extract of data thorough your observation in Notes, Models, etc to manage you internal state of solving the problem and that you are a Problem in trying to solve the Problem in the dish (you have a energy, enthusiasm, saturation through focusing on the same problem that you cannot create new connections with better models or brute force, etc). This may already exist and someone has almost certainly made a similar model and if so I will probably find it or be told of it and I will integrate, reference it and iterate on it.

- `Problem Microscope` - observation that a problem has a context internal and external (your solving context; mood, temperature, etc), which the internal context as a scale
	- Have you classified the problems as layers?
	- Are you accounting for dimensionality?
		- Time-lining 
		- Vectors data connected across Problem layers that require modelling or you are zooming in and out and in and out
		- Agents:
			- Red Teaming thinking
	- Are focusing on the extremes, too far out to find detail or too far in to understand connections?
	- Are you one too many layers in or out - are you off a layer compare focus point and objective and layers:
		- `A`(you may need to look here)... , `N`(you are here) `B`...(you may need to look here even if it is `A` for confirmation by comparison)
	- Are you using this model too much and not noting anything down in a organised way?
