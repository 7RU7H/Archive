# Tradecraft to BrainCraft

Information is everywhere and everything and even beyond that there is information about information and therefore making sense of everything that is relevant and significant with difficult problems requires a set of problem solving techniques that are found in Intelligence Analytics and "Trade Craft" of other contexts. This page is me attempt to compress this information into useful cognitive schemata to make actionable techniques to memorise.

	- Regardless of this being allegedly from 2009 the importance of fundamental base-lining of how to think is far more important that how *internet-recent* and up-to-date the techniques are. This is where this page started from. Lowest common denominator techniques that not any special technology (computational, analytical, cognitive, etc) that are all publicly available - Authors Assumption

## Reasoning about information

[[Reasoning-Typology]]

#### True/False (Positives and Negatives) and the Null Space 

True Positives - Detected and is vulnerable
True Negatives - Found not to be vulnerable, but detection mechanism enumerated successfully
[False Positives](https://www.cgisecurity.com/questions/falsepositive.shtml) - detected, but not vulnerable
[False Negatives](https://www.cgisecurity.com/questions/falsenegative.shtml) - not detected, but detection mechanism failed

Null Space - 
- What do clues connected together within a hypothesis may indicate theory to be true or false
- Example from @MalwareJake: - Nuking the Log off the Event Logs, but there is still Log on Event and the system has not rebooted or shuck down
	- Find:
		- What is not there, but should be
		- What is there, but should not be
	- Consider how atypical the logic chain of events is a why it may have happened
	- Always collect clues and not opinions - collecting opinion lead nowhere, but clues a pieces of a puzzle leading somewhere

- Consider how your problem is on OSI layer - Please Do Not Throw Away Sausage Pizza

This inspired by reading the above link and *improving* it slightly 

- Methodological Use Requires:
	- You are a dataset - you contaminate the all other informational data sets 
	- Be systematic in every respect of everything with everything
	- Data Segregation - Do not contaminate :
		- You are a dataset - you contaminate the all other informational data sets 
		- Collection and Organisation:
			- Timelining
			- Do not categorise or allow for multidimensional labelling of categorises
		- Workspace - must be contained a separate 
			- Categorises must not be pervasive to or from 
		- Potential Conclusions Spaces
			- Segment Narrotologically/Conceptual/Typological - "whole" potential conclusions 
			- Allow for alternatives
	- Identify relevant and diagnostic information
	- Create metrics and heuristics to describe the process of analysis, each workspaces properties
	- Review the list of biases on a weekly basis - **It is so important NOT to put a list of bias when describing biases here as:**
		- You need to actual review each bias and know each to recognise it and know which you **cannot change**:
			- Anchoring Bias
			- Categorically Biases
				- How?
					- Over-Generalisation
					- Under-Generalisation
					- True, False Positives and Negatives
					- ...
				- Types
					- Linguistics, Sensual, Long-Term Psychological
	- Identify the **systems** in the mapping of the informational domain - much like hacking if you do not know the system in place you can hack it
- Diagnostic Techniques
	- Key Assumptions Check
		- Assumptions are neurological shortcuts or symbolic-links to a pattern that *bypasses* checks that could be done by the frontal context - beware!
		- CIA: *"List and review the key working assumptions on which fundamental judgements rest"*
		- Ask questions during process:
			- How much confidence exists that this assumption is correct?
			- What explains the degree of confidence in the assumption?
			- What circumstances or information might undermine this assumption?
			- Is a key assumption more likely a key uncertainty or key factor?
			- Could the assumption have been true in the past but less so now?
			-  If the assumption proves to be wrong, would it significantly alter the analytic line? How?
			- Has this process identified new factors that need further analysis?
	- Quality of Information Checks
		- CIA: *"Evaluates completeness and soundness of available information sources."*
		- Who, what, where, why, how - in what context - metadata and full discourse appraisal
		- Is a scientific or replicatable method used? 
		- Is is mathematical proof or an BS (everything unless the truthful true provable is just BS)
	- Indicators or Signposts of Change 
		- CIA: *"Periodically review a list of observable events or trends to track events, monitor targets, spot emerging trends, and warn of unanticipated change."*
		- Everything always changes at the molecular level and therefore to the best effectiveness periodic checking rather than using assumptions - [[Social-Engineering]] like simple scams use your brain's shortcuts (assumptions) to bypass your frontal cortex. Do not scam yourself
	- Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)
		- CIA: *"Identification of alternative explanations (hypotheses) and evaluation of all evidence that will disconfirm rather than confirm hypotheses."*
- Contrarian Techniques
	- Go-Full-Reductionist:
		- Find the bounds of which a set ideas are constrained by requiring more than the most reductionist stance on the subject matter. 
	- Go-Full-Contrarian and find the [Reductio ad absurdum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum)
		- Frame the commonly accepted in a absurd contrarian hypothetical example
	- Back in my reality.. Culture superstition
		- Deliberately superimpose another reality from a different culture (potentially from different time if it subtle (i.e. Roman slave reality is not really useful for Packet Analysis))
	- Roast the ideas, not the analyst:
		- Frame the analysis in lexicon, syntax of a stand up comedian to simplify and shift perspective of information as if you are [roasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_(comedy)) the idea
	- Tell me all the connections like I am five in reverse as a linear sequence from a point `n` of assumed `N`...:
		- Spot looping and branching, till you are very frustrated or found new paths out of brute-forcing a conversation with the participant enragingly requesting the next connecting response
	- Devil’s Advocacy
		-  CIA: *"Challenging a single, strongly held view or consensus by building the best possible case for an alternative explanation"*
	- Team A/Team B
		-  CIA: *"Use of separate analytic teams that contrast two (or more) strongly held views or competing hypotheses."*
	- High-Impact/Low-Probability Analysis
		-  CIA: *"Highlights a seemingly unlikely event that would have major policy consequences if it happened."*
	- “What If?” Analysis
		-  CIA: *"Assumes that an event has occurred with potential (negative or positive) impact and explains how it might come about."* 
- Imaginative Thinking Techniques
	- Brainstorming
		-  CIA: *"An unconstrained group process designed to generate new ideas and concepts"*
	- Outside-In Thinking:
		- CIA: *"Used to identify the full range of basic forces, factors, and trends that would indirectly shape an issue"*
	- Red Team Analysis
		- CIA: *"Models the behaviour of an individual or group by trying to replicate how an adversary would think about an issue"*
	- Alternative Futures Analysis
		- CIA: "*Systematically explores multiple ways a situation can develop when there is high complexity and uncertainty*"
- Strategies for Using Structured Analytic Techniques
