```c
// Trap 1 - Supurious Correlation
Correlation != Causation

// Trap 2 - Simpson's Paradox - J. Pearl summarised: Treatment is good for men and women, but bad for a person.
Conditions on Covariate // Apply types

// Trap 3 - Symetry 
Causality in Detirministic Universe is always asymetrical
- Algebra is bad -> use: 

Structural Causal Model: Directed Acyclic Graph

Structural Equation Models: X := fi(x) 
```
