# Problem Solving


#### Starting Points

[YouTube - How to solve any problem - Maths Sorcerer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9SONj3fHz0):
1. You have to understand the problem
2. Find the connection between the data and the unknown. You may be obliged to consider auxiliary problems if an immediate connection cannot be found. You should obtain eventually a plan of the solution.
3. Carry out your plan
4. Examine the solution obtained

Reframe the problems
Other good peoples - collaborate
What is the real problem
Slice and dice the problem
Similar Problems?
Is the place you are at the best place to do this kind of problem?
What is percentage solved by the difficulty of the problem?
Side Channels exist
Embrace the hack

Are you affected by Streetlight Effect?
Trends are past data, does the past reflect the future at some ratio?
Do you understand the causality chain?
Worst case scenarios happen, what is the spectrum = do not confuse with likelihood spectrum
Is there a analogy and example for that?
You Never Run out of Bullets - shit happens, linear thinking does not account for everything?
Emotions can Kill people and analytical process, are they affecting you?

Have you applied type theory?
Thinkers have styles, are you mixing another styles or understanding your styles failings affecting analysis?
What do you thinking partners thin and are they diverse enough, did you start together (you need to start together)?
Are you measurements for good analysis (non)functioning or find the nullspace and oddities they should? 
Are you respecting intuition measurably?  

CARL - Construct Analytically Revised Landscapes

- Is it solvable in a specific time frame and set of obtainable resources?- 
	- Is it possible that the problem itself has no ACTUAL solution, by design? See Anti Puzzle
- Typology
	- Identifying the type of Problem - Is type of Problem is the Problem? 
		- White, Grey or Black Box Problems
			- Components of Problem and SubProblems
			- Knowable Pathing and State Tracking recursion Problems
			- Partial (un)Knowable Pathing and State Tracking recursion Problems
			- Insight Problems
			- Domain Knowledge Problems
		- White Box is entirely knowable, black boxes are mostly unknownable? How can we know the unknowable? We can easily here are just a few ways:
			- Are you documenting input and timelining
			- Are you copying the original state of the blackbox to protect ourselves from state change
			- Comparing 2 blackboxes copies at the original state at timed intervals is time a factor in a subcompoent of any internal function that utilizes 
			- Are you accounting that the internal state is saved affecting the same input and creating new output?
			- Can by input, output, errors, unexpected behaviour (timing attacks) deduce potential sub components to the blackbox
			- What similar white box exist that would indicate that the blackbox has similar subcomponents?
			- Can we side channel the blackbox
			- Can capture the internal state and simulate actions or review data in isolation such that it won't affect the original blackbox
- Structure
- Unstructural
- Data Domain
- Discourse
- Beyond Accepted Current Understanding (BACU)
- Boolean and AntiBoolean Indicators
	- Null space
		- What do clues connected together within a hypothesis may indicate theory to be true or false
	- Example from @MalwareJake: - Nuking the Log off the Event Logs, but there is still Log on Event and the system has not rebooted or shut down
		- Find:
			- What is not there, but should be
			- What is there, but should not be
		- Consider how atypical the logic chain of events is a why it may have happened
		- Always collect clues and not opinions - collecting opinion lead nowhere, but clues a pieces of a puzzle leading somewhere
	- True positive.. 
	- ...

Problem solving - issue: antipuzzle is not found while dorking; math sorcerer video is absurdly simple and not great

AntiPuzzle - comment from youtube Vsauce puzzle I was never able to solve:
- icevlad148: The only way to get a wrong answer is to think about the solution
