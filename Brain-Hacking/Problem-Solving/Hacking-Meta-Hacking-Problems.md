## Hacking Meta Hacking Problems

#### Relevance in Solutions

When troubleshooting or solving some problems sometimes it is easy to forget that you need to use the pieces of a given solution found online in a more relevant way for your problem. Simply the online solution is not wrong it may need to be changed.

#### Terminology and definitional relativity

Beware of organisation X defining or terming the boundary of a role or concept.

#### Immediate Fruit or Data Bounty Problem

An issue I have found in thinking about how others accounts of and my own performing of problem solving that either leads a dichotomy, which best solution is to recognise the alternative to that dichotomy, which is do both. Either primary intuitive objective is the obtainment of completeness of data collection versus performing only what is required potential/actual solution. 

The conflict arises intuitively. To do either is hazardous even if you actually suceed and you may reinforce a intuition that actually is very negative even if it is successful. The amount of information to retain and reuse and that can be presented in performing what aspect of hacking such that fixation on either or. Multiple objectives that can achieved in paralell are not necassarily   

Solution:

Stop before all common actions:
- On the minimum information what will presumabley solve the problem - segment from by noting and mapping a negative space 
- What negative space data could exist that is block from the foreground of the problem solving taken by the potential immediate solution

Even if you find nothing or is not required more data is aways good. You also saved time by doing both and forcing yourself to think about a large context and potential context that can be infered from current level of information gathered. You save time by performing the necessary action that did not require a greater amount of data.
