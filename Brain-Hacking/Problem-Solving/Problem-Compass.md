# Problem Compass

**This section contains an abundance Authorial Opinions and Philosophising that some may find offensive, junk or not adhering to their reality**, I am very happy to bow to the **scientific reasoning and critical reasoning of others** done with quality assured methods. Also this model contain potshots and people and nonsense that is high circulated for profit and I if those that participate conceptual racketeering should do so for free if it was that important that it trumps established reasoning and methods to reason about anything that by design seek to improve on the what been established in a provable way.

Collapsing recursion with the Cardinality of Problems Compass 
- You are in the middle of a problem that is life, full of problems here are the cardinal three dimensional states that cause problems, also time and space are collapsed (spacial and temporal directions align) ahead = future, behind = past, right and left = parallel to the same and one universe (absolutely no many worlds, simulations as they are collapse as a concept within your imagination, which is subordinate to the universe, which is another reason this model exist as I really dislike hype those models and book racketeering)
- `ahead`, the could in the future - the horizon
	- Theorising, worrying too far `ahead`s
	- Not understanding that the non-flat earth, means that problem over the horizon get undefinable like curvature  
- `below`, the pit below
	- Nested conditional hell hole of (crypto-/pseudo/feels-like)exponential  `below`
	- The worrying pit of ifs, buts, possibilities 
- Nostalgia-ing to the `behind`
	- Memories can be seductive, generally the traumatic is not remembered 
	- PTSD is a real problem
- `here` 
	- Procastinating or nullworking on the spot `here`
		- Stop and what is on the to do list, not the recommended by third party list
- Weight of the sky filled with problems `above`
	- Crushing abstraction that is weightless and navigable as provable by suicide being a choice taken when it is perceived to the best choice for the individual  

Finally if there was not money in postulating nonsense theories of the universe then Simulation Theory and Many Worlds Theory would stay in academic discussion with rigour of academics trying to out do one another. If its your pet nonsense, put online for free forever and stop or do something worth while with your time.
