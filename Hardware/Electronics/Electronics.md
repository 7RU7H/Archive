- Use X and Y to pass current through components to find shorts
	- Short circuit - where current cannot pass thorough 
	- Open circuit  - where current can pass thorough
- Components have a point on them that you can pass current thorough that is not connected to the intended circuit  



| Electronic term | Water equivalence |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Current         | Flow              |
| Voltage         | Pressure          |

- Resistors reduces current
	 - these can spiral internal to create more length
- Capacitors temporary store positive and negative charge on either side of insulated material between the two conductive surfaces
	- Can be multilayered
- Diode allow current to flow in one direction and not the other
- Transistor
