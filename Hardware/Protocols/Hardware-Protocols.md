#  Hardware Protocol

The essentially commutation over a wire is commonly created by the device turning the a signal On and Off, Ones and Zeros - each a bit a binary value of sequence of eight bits can be considered a byte. In [[Hardware-Hacking]] - Logic Analysers are device can analyse the signals between devices communicating and visualise these communication.
