# Virtual Machines

Before continuing it is recommended that you check whether you had run any type of virtualisation on your hardware, if you can you may need to boot up and configure the virtualization setting for your cpu in the BIOS.

## Hardware Resource Requirements

- A CPU that supports virtualisation.
- More CPU Core for more VMs or more powerful VM(s)
- RAM more the merrier
- HD Space

## VirtualBox Or  VMware?

## Packer or Vagrant or Both

Packer and Vagrant are developed by Hashicorp, therefore be aware which documentation you are reading. Both are primarily classified as **"Infrastructure Build"** and **"Virtual Machine Management"** tools respectively. Packer creates identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. Vagrant builds and distributes development environments.
