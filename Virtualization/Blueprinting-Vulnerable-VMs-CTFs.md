These are just notes of thinking about how to make a good vulnerable machine: 

WORK IN PROGRESS


Difficulty should really curve and there should really only be one way

Real world, but really cool. 
Puzzles need revenerence, maximise it by make correct solution visuably impactful not sirens(unless its like an alert, you have x time to do y) like exploit demonstrates itself in ascii, tie to flare in story,

Defy the actually structure.
Smbshare -> linPrivEsc -> Webexploit to then root

Story and all its trappings
- Less is ALOT more and must be interconnected to technique
- Story it payoff not marker unless symbiotic with puzzle solution

Theme that you want in your tmux or wallpaper
Code or Jpg Tinkets - flags arent enough

Mechanically interesting features that tie into vulnerabilities/misconfigurations

No cheap pathing

-  unless it is challenge for X 
No cipher challenge
No bruteforcing, cracking, if it muat should be indicated or instructive around cli or a tool tool that makes interest wordlists

Example: 

Fit the story around the system administration of the VM(s)
Genetic sequence of an anedote of ransomed hostage whom infected with a virus, you have to data exfiltrate segments. The sysadmin of this crinimal gang want as payment system with https, but there want to sandbox any connections and monitor traffic to that page.1

infiltrate, stealth bypass, trick x to port forwars, injection attack on the inyernally facing ransom website to get root
