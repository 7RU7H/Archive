## DNS zone transfer
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_zone_transfer)
*DNS zone transfer, also sometimes known by the inducing DNS query type AXFR, is a type of DNS transaction. It is one of the many mechanisms available for administrators to replicate DNS databases across a set of DNS servers. A zone transfer uses the Transmission Control Protocol for transport, and takes the form of a clientâ€“server transaction.*

```bash
dnsrecon -t axfr -d $DOMAIN
dig axfr $domain @$ip
host $url 		# ip for a domain
host -t ns $url # find nameservers for a domain
host -t mx $url # find mailservers for a domain
host -l $domain $ns1-domain # List of DNS servers
```

Parse just DNS hostnames
```bash
for server in $(host -t ns megacorpone.com | cut -d" " -f4); do host -l megacorpone.com $server; done
```
