# Vulnerability Scanning

## Methodological Considerations

1. Vulnerability Signatures use by that crash the application
2. Misleading results
	1. [False Positives](https://www.cgisecurity.com/questions/falsepositive.shtml) - indications it's vulnerable, but it's actually not!
	2. [False Negatives](https://www.cgisecurity.com/questions/falsenegative.shtml) - indication it's not vulnerable, but in actuality it is!
	3. Backporting can be a possible reason for false positive and negatives, developers rolling back software patches to older versions for development rationals.
3. Use cases for automation vs. manual
	1. For precision, minimal network footprint -> manual analysis
	2. For large engagements with time constraints -> automated analysis
	3. Regardless costs time, planning on the correct balance of both is required.
4. Scan configurations could harm target
5. Scan configurations are extensive and complex
6. Relative location to target affects:
	1. Speed 
	2. Access rights
	3. Visibility of target such that methods used by scanner would not work
		1. ARP traffic is internal network only
		2. ICMP request may be blocked
	4. Potential packet interference
		1. IPS, Firewalls

Authenicated scanning can provide greater detail as the relative position in terms of access to the network resources and data is greater. For Linux, enable SSH on target and configure the scanner to proxy through it. For Windows, it generally requires Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and credentials for domain or a local account *with remote management permissions*. Even then, User Account Control (UAC) and Firewall setting may still block authenication.
