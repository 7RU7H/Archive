# Chat GPT Whispering

ChatGPT Whispering is a just a term I made up while thinking about applying ChatGPT it is the best term I could think of that would be similar to [[Search-Engine-Dorking]]. As quick disclaimer this information was gathered in the early stages of the free release of ChatGPT - model improve and some of the information maybe become invalid.

Some of this article maybe considered as critical, but to get the most out ChatGPT I think it is best understand the flaws and issues to make you more cogniziant questioner 

## Beware

- It does not (at lauch) cite references
- It can be incorrect and its inferenciable that English tone is very arrogant and can be very misleading.
- Its verbosity is own weakness - it pads outs answers with discourse
- It limited in its capicity answer by ethical, legal, etc restraints. Its content policy will almost certianly have telemetry and also limits its usefulness, but you generally can rephrase questions and get answers that bypass this policy. 


## Goals of ChatGPT Whispering

Limit output verbosity
Specificity


- Recursively ask follow-up questions
