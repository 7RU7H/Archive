# Authors Opinions LLM

TL;DR: Good luck and thanks for all the free YouTube AI lesson over the years. LLM AI will be the biggest waste of money and water in human history to produce the data and decision making equivalence of SLUDGE - 2/2/2024

Authors warning, please be aware I am retarded, regardless of that the product of this for the Archive:
- Goal to retroactively remove all AI content I have used to make this 

After thinking and considering the initial version of my notes for the page: [[LLM-Malware]], having not been to BlackHat, use LLMs on and off since ChatGPT-3, learnt about ML and Deep Learning over the years; I have com e to the conclusion that AI and Humans in their current state are not going to be able to prevent the excessive waste of money, water ( from data centres), or actually have good LLM in any sense.

Why?
- APTs will target other APTs and Country affiliates AI infrastructure at peacetime or war
	- Meaning AI will always be threatened and security risk that also makes humans using LLMs vulnerable to reliance and compliance vulnerabilities
- Everyone makes mistakes 
	- Good luck future proofing and proving a human/LLM has not made a mistake
- Misconfiguration happens
	 - Good luck future proofing and proving a human/LLM has not made a mistake
- Misalignment happens
	- Good luck future proofing and proving a human/LLM has not made a mistake
- Most people do not understand AI or InfoSec and see `X=power` or `Y=Money` and that is it
	- Good luck training people to not trust the backbone of decision making, because it could be poisoned 
- The compute and race-condition madness required to compare LLM is mathematically insane
- The argument that continuous supportive AI protects other AI model or repair LLM is nuts
	- Ransomware poisoning Backups is so expensive companies are advised to fold and hand over ransom in the understanding the ransomware operator will leave, because then it would bad for business if they did not 
- Every institution are incentivized (similar to nukes) to waste their money, time, water, human resources to develop and maintain AI tooling, AND then there are all the security issues 
	- At least nukes have a lifespan longer than one year.  
	- Maintaining and Securing AI is too expensive

There the most probable sum total of all *probable* interaction for humans and LLMs are heading toward is the best waste of water, money, compute, infrastructure, human work in human history. LLM are just bad the lack of cohesion as a species
