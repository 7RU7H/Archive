- How Big Is AI, really?
- How It will affect software?
- How It will affect security?
- Some early tool output
- What you can do to get ready?

It is not AI it is context powered software!
## AI

Hierarchy of significant technology

1. Post-2023 AI
2. Printing Press 
3. Internet 
4. Computer
5. Mobile

Previous industrial Revolutions attacked specific work task, AI is different is replacing intelligence itself.

- Agriculture Revolution 10,000 BC
	- Farming, animal domestication
	- Pivot to: Hunter-gatherer to farming and herding
- Industrial Revolution 1.0 1760-1840
	- Steam power textile mechanisation, iron production
	- Pivot to: Industrial labour, machine operation  
- Industrial Revolution 2.0 1870-1914
	- Electricity, assembly lines, internal combustion engine
	- Pivot to: assembly-line workers, machine operators, engineers
- Industrial Revolution 3.0 1950-1970
	- Computers semiconductors, internet
	- Pivot to: digital and service roles, programmers, IT specialists 
- Industrial Revolution 4.0 2000-202
	- AI, 3D printing, IoT
	- Pivot to: creative, complex problem solving, tech-based roles 

## What do you pivot now?

We are out of pivots..there are defensive positions to take to this do not worry

## Software

LLM will replace LLM software. Traditional software is crystalline backend - it is brittle and static. The schema is strict. Schema cant really change or extract anything that is not part of it. Queries are limited, but the structural data, which is limiting the frontend by the way frontend communicates with the backend.

Context will become the most important word in Software. 

From queries to questions
- Rigid Queries -> Human questions
- Send to Rigid Databases -> sent to LLMs
- Lacking Context -> That work off context

#### SPQA Architecture

State - part of the context
Policy - part of the context
Questions - are the new interface
Action - actionable actions!

LLM are stupid without context, you need to define context.

Software verticals become just questions, with LLMs everything is about how good your data is and how good your questions are.

## Security

#### State

Context about company:
- History
- Goals
- Security Goals
- Architecture
- Current configurations

Dynamically updated security activity log to collect context
#### Question

LLM can be prompted to answer the follow per security scenario:
- Ask is scenario allowed? 
- Give Yes/No response 
- Explain your response

If CISO authorises an counter action.. then the action will be configured update the security policy and the security system is updated to understand our security concerns.
#### Actions

- Complex security configuration updating
- Summarising 
- Invisible problems 
	- like human problems - e.g fear of reporting are tackled
- Dynamic updating response based on context
- Evaluation based on a specification of the organisations context


## Takeaways

- Think about business in terms of SQA context and questions
- Do you have Context and Questions that other do not?
- Could you articulate your mission and goals and KPIs and start collecting state?
- Know what the questions that matter most.
