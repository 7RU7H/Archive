#  AI Whispering

ChatGPT Whispering is a just a term I made up while thinking about applying ChatGPT it is the best term I could think of that would be similar to [[Search-Engine-Dorking]]. As quick disclaimer this information was gathered in the early stages of the free release of ChatGPT - model improve and some of the information maybe become invalid.

Some of this article maybe considered as critical, but to get the most out ChatGPT I think it is best understand the flaws and issues to make you more cogniziant questioner 

## Beware

- If something is not documented it won't tell you! It will answer incorrectly 
- It does not (at lauch) cite references
- It can be incorrect and its inferenciable that English tone is very arrogant and can be very misleading.
- Its verbosity is own weakness - it pads outs answers with discourse
- It limited in its capicity answer by ethical, legal, etc restraints. Its content policy will almost certianly have telemetry and also limits its usefulness, but you generally can rephrase questions and get answers that bypass this policy. 
- ChatGPT can be very very wrong

## Goals of ChatGPT Whispering

- Get better answers
- Limit output verbosity
- Specificity in answering
- Weed out undocumented answers - if an AI or Special Human can't find something that should be documented it probably should be
- Recursively ask follow-up questions

- Explain Code
- Improve X
- Rewrite X with Y - style specification, idiomatic contructs 
- Simplify
- Write Tests
- Alternative to X
- Translate X to Y
- Write documentation for X
- Find bugs
- Scaffolding code to speed up process
