[DEF CON 32 - Social Engineering Like you’re Picard - Jayson E Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc25CttuDmw) YouTube description: *"AI is transforming social engineering. Using tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot, attackers can make phishing and vishing attacks nearly impossible to distinguish from legitimate Interactions. This presentation will demonstrate how virtually anyone with a pulse can now use AI to craft sophisticated phishing sites and conduct vishing operations with unprecedented subtlety and effectiveness. These next-generation techniques are transforming the landscape of social engineering. You will learn how to replicate these advanced techniques to elevate your own social-engineering game. You will learn how criminals can manipulate AI tools to simulate real-world attacks and gain a deeper insight into their tactics. You’ll learn how to use A.I. to enhance how you attack now & ways for it to supplement skills you don’t currently have. You will learn how to leverage these techniques to transform an organization’s, traditional, “security awareness” mentality into a “situational awareness” mindset. Using real-world examples, we demonstrate turning potential threats into teachable moments. This session is essential for anyone looking to harness the power of AI in hacking and Red Teaming. We offer practical skills to engage employees and enhance your approach to social engineering both offensively and defensively. And yes, we do this with a certain theme in mind as I ENGAGE the audience as we boldly go where no Hackers have gone before!"*

## Authors Notes:

"Any sufficentiently advanced technology is indistinguished from magic" - Arthur C. Clark

In the hacking community, we like advanced technology we do not have to work.
AI this and AI that, remember when blockchain, EDR, IPS, Stateful inspect Firewall were going to save us.
ML talks are done on shellsheats; AI talks are done on powerpoint.. Modern concerns about Low hanging fruit concerns - "Get the fruit off the ground, you are not ready for the tree."

"Any sufficiently common technology is indistringuishable from an attack tool" - Jayson E. Street

AI does some good - this is not a anti-AI talk, but criminals use it too.


AI can provide the modern colloqialisms for locations to blend in 

AI can provide a question list for SE 

SE the AI like Picard to get what you want. Change the follow question tone, context, etc referencing the previous requirements embedded

Situational > Security Awareness

Teach them how it matters to your end users can be situational aware at **home**.

Make things relatable and show them not give them jargon or technical details. 
Show the real world attacks and show the them the real wins.

Show your end users how not to just see the world at a glance. We as human are on autopilot a lot, teach them to see the strange in autopilot.
