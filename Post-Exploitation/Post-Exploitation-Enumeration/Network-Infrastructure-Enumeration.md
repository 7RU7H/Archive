# Network Infrastructure Enumeration

One of the primary object upon gaining initial access to a network is assessing the current structure of the network and the accessibility between points within it. As networks are segmented and separated internally and externally from each other and within one another.

Noisy tools like collector Sharphound, see [[Bloodhound-Guide]] can visualise the network.

## Typology

- **Internal Networks** are: subnets that are segmented and separated based on the importance of the internal device or the importance of the accessibility of its data with the purpose of sharing information, faster and easier communications, collaboration tools, operational systems, and network services within an organisation.
- **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)** - is a Network that is located at the edge network that it protects. A common design for DMZ is a subnet that sits between the public internet and internal networks.

[[Active-Directory-Defined]] contains objects that constitute a AD Network.
