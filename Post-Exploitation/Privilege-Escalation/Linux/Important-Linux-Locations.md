With [[File-Inclusion-And-Directory-Traversal]] `/proc/self/cwd` is webserver symlinked web directory.
`/dev/shm` is share memory and so [[Linux-File-Transfers]] to this directory be more evasive.

```bash
/proc/self/environ # Process context
/proc/1/cgroup    # Docker container 
/etc/$imageName-release # Docker image version
```
