# Privilege Escalution Defined

In the [[Lockhead-Martin-Cyber-Kill-Chain]], after intial [[Foothold-On-AD]] or any other Server or Machine, the next step is the increase the level of access rights on host machine. This process is called Privilege Escalution, two phase process:
1. Gathering information phase 
2. Attempting to move vertically or horizontally with information gather

Repeat the previous to processes till at the highest level of access rights.
Target machines can be consider unique given differences in operating systems, patch level, network connectivy, service operable, etc. [[Linux-Privilege-Escalation]] differs from [[Windows-Privilege-Escalation]] and [[Active-Directory-Privilege-Escalation]] architectural, but the search for misconfigurations, permissive lack of restrictions, vulnerabilities(running or static) in software or kernel space, leaked sensitive information stored in files (log, configuration, emails, etc), databases, registery settings or hardcode credentials, and more!

Enumeration can be done manually or be automated

## Manual Enumeration 

1. Users
2. Hostname
3. OS version and architecture
4. Processes
5. Services
6. Scheduled Tasks
7. Networking Information
8. Firewall status and rules
9. Installed Applications
10. Patch levels
11. Readable/Writable Files and Directories
12. Unmounted Disks
13. Device Drivers
14. Kernel Modules
15. Binaries That AutoElevate

## Automated Enuemration

Script help automate the information gathering process, various are list in [[Linux-Privilege-Escalation]], [[Windows-Privilege-Escalation]] and [[Active-Directory-Privilege-Escalation]]. Some specific script cheat/helpsheets avaliable in [[Contents]] of Archive are:
