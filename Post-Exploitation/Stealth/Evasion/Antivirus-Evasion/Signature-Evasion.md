# Signature Evasion

Identifying signatures requires recursive splitting and testing to find the byte a signature starts from.

[Threatcheck.exe](https://github.com/rasta-mouse/ThreatCheck)

Split binaries manually or just use [PowerShell Mafia's  Find-AVSignature.ps1](-AVSignature.ps1), but requires an appropriate interval to be set to function properly.
```bash
head 
dd
# Split is also on 
split
```

```powershell
# Read a file a hex
format-hex $file.exe

```
