# ETW-Evasion Patching Tracing Functions

Patching Tracing Functions is a [[Logging-And-Monitoring-Evasion]] technique 


ETW is loaded from the runtime of every new process, commonly originating from the **CLR** (**C**ommon **L**anguage **R**untime). Within a new process, ETW events are sent from the userland and issued directly from the current process. 


An attacker can write pre-defined opcodes to an in-memory function of ETW to patch and disable functionality.
