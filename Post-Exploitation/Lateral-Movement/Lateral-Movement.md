# Lateral Movement

Once a network is breached Lateral Movement categorises techniques that allow an attacker to move around the network. Lateral movement can be described as a technique used to further our access to additional `hosts`, `applications`, and `services` within a network environment. Lateral Movement is not [[Tunneling]]; Tunneling is the encapsulation of network traffic into another protocol and routes traffic through that protocol. Lateral Movement is not [[Pivoting]];  Pivoting is utilising multiple hosts to cross network boundaries you would not usually have access to. The how of Lateral Movement over specific Networks are covered separately in articles such as: 
- [[Active-Directory-Lateral-Movement]]
