# File Transfers
Some methods are destructive and should be used with caution. All Post Exploitation binaries and scripts use should be documented to aid in cleaning up after engagement. 

1. For stealth and professionalism they could be found revealing foothold and potential abused for malicious individuals. Documenting each upload helps keep a inventory of use where and how, networks can get very large and it not ideal to have to traverse the entire network to remove one file you forgot to document and missed in cleaning up.
2. Antivirus scans endpoint filesystems in search of pre-defined file signatures which are mapped from open/closed source tools in wide use from open resources like [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload). AV should alert System Adminstrators and will quarantine any offending binaries or scripts.

Therefore its best practice to live off the land as regards to Post Exploitation only until a tool is needed to bypass or escalate further.

## SCP
```bash
# Copy a local file to remote host 
scp <file> <user>@<host>:<dest>

# dump user directory with wildcard *
scp -i id_rsa user@10.10.10.10:* . 

# To copy a file from a remote server to your local machine:
scp -P $portnumber <user>@<host>:<src> <dest>

# To scp a file over a SOCKS proxy on localhost and port 9999 (see ssh for tunnel setup):
scp -o "ProxyCommand nc -x 127.0.0.1:9999 -X 4 %h %p" <file> <user>@<host>:<dest>

# To scp between two remote servers from the third machine:
scp -3 <user>@<host1>:<src> <user>@<host2>:<dest>
```


## PureFTPd
```bash
sudo apt install pure-ftpd
```

Setup script 
```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo groupadd ftpgroup
sudo useradd -g ftpgroup -d /dev/null -s /etc ftpuser

sudo pure-pw mkdb
sudo cd /etc/pure-ftpd/auth/
sudo ln -s ../conf/PureDB 60pdb
sudo mkdir -p /ftphome
sudo chown -R ftpuser:ftpgroup /ftphome/
sudo systemctl restart pure-ftpd
```

## Python
