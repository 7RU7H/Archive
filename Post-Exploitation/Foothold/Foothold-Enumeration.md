# Foothold Enumeration

Post exploitation that grant a foothold on a inital network box then leads to the next phase in the [[Lockhead-Martin-Cyber-Kill-Chain]] of another phase of information gathering about the users, OS and kernel, system and service configuration, hardware, network infrastructure ...

For OS specific command line cheatsheet see [[Core-Linux-Commands]] and [[Windows-CLI-cmd]] for some but check the directory for other for modules and other shells. 

For OS specific privilege escalation cheatsheets: [[Linux-Privilege-Escalation]], [[Windows-Privilege-Escalation]], a general set of commands and links to how some the table contents work will be linked below.
