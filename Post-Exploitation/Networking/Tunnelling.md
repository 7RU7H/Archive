# Tunnelling


Tunnelling is the encapsulation of network traffic into another protocol and routes traffic through that protocol. [[Tunnelling]] is not [[Pivoting]];  Pivoting is utilising multiple hosts to cross network boundaries you would not usually have access to. Tunneling is not Lateral Movement ([[Lateral-Movement]]) ; Lateral movement can be described as a technique used to further our access to additional `hosts`, `applications`, and `services` within a network environment.

#### Traffic Encapsulation - Bypassing deep packet inspection

```bash
# http tunnel on server side:
sudo hts -F <server ip addr>:<port of your app> 80  
# On client side:
sudo htc -P <my proxy.com:proxy port> -F <port of your app> <server ip addr>:80 stunnel
```
