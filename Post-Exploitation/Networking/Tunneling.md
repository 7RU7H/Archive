# Tunneling


Tunneling is the encapsulation of network traffic into another protocol and routes traffic through that protocol. [[Tunneling]] is not [[Pivoting]];  Pivoting is utilising multiple hosts to cross network boundaries you would not usually have access to. Tunneling is not Lateral Movement ([[Lateral-Movement]]) ; Lateral movement can be described as a technique used to further our access to additional `hosts`, `applications`, and `services` within a network environment.
