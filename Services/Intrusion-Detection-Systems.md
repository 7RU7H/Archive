# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a system that detects unauthorised network and system intrusions. Examples include detecting unauthorised devices connected to the local network and unauthorised users accessing a system or modifying a file.

## Types of IDS:

#### Network Instrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)
- Monitors traffic flow from various part of the network
- Investigate traffic on the entire subnet
- If a signature is identified creates an alert 

#### Host-Based  Detection Intrusion System (HIDS)
- Monitor single endpoint device
- Investigate traffic on said endpoint
- If a signature is identified creates an alert 

## Detection types:

Signature-based: Signatures of known maliciou traffic fed into IDS.
Anomaly/Behaviour-based: Regular traffic model, for IDS to detect anomalies.
Policy-based: Detect based on policy violations
