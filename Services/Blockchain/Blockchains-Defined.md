# Blockchains Defined

## Introduction


A [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a type of [distributed ledger technology (DLT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger "Distributed ledger") that consists of growing lists of [records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science) "Record (computer science)"), called _blocks_, that are securely linked together using [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography "Cryptography").


## Smart Contracts

**Beware Smart Contracts do not typically constitute a valid binding agreement at law!**

**If it is never legal binding - RUN FAR, FAR AWAY**

**Successful human enterprise for over 10 thousand years is built on legality in primitive (non-written) and modern sense to arbitate transactions between humans**

Cryptocurrency lovers (*joke*) and Star Trek's Ferengi quote: *"Once you have there money, never give it back"*.

[Smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) is a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") or a [transaction protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_Protocol_Data_Unit "Transaction Protocol Data Unit") that is intended to automatically execute, control or document events and actions according to the terms of a [contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract "Contract") or an agreement

[THM AoC 4](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber4): *"Smart contracts are most commonly used as the backbone of DeFi applications (Decentralized Finance applications) to support a cryptocurrency on a blockchain. DeFi applications facilitate currency exchange between entities; a smart contract defines the details of the exchange. A smart contract is a program stored on a blockchain that runs when pre-determined conditions are met."*

Smart Contracts are just functions (i.e Deposit, Withdraw) wrapped together as in:
`Pay Alice X amount of Y Cryptocurrency if Alice's Balance Z is not Empty to Bob` 
`Pay Amount`, `If Balance`, `To`  without the context.
