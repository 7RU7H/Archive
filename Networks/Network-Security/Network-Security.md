# Network Security


## Access Control

Any control that attempt to ensure authentication and authorization.

- [[Firewalls]] - Controls incoming and outgoing network traffic with predetermined security rules
- Network Access Control (NAC) - verifies device specifications and conditions as to whether it is compliant with a profile
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) - Controls and manages the asset identities and user access to data systems and resources over the network.
- Load Balancing - Controls resource usage to distribute task across a set of resources
- Network Segmentation - segmentation divides a network in smaller sections to improve performance and security
- Virtual Private Networks (VPN) - encrypted communication commonly with [[IPsec]] protocol
- Zero Trust Model - "*Zero Trust is a security framework requiring all users, whether in or outside the organizationâ€™s network, to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validated for security configuration and posture before being granted or keeping access to applications and data.*" - [Crowdstrike definition of Zero Trust Security](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-security/)

## Threat Control

- Intrusion Detection and Prevention - Inspects the traffic and creates alerts (IDS) or resets the connection (IPS) when detecting an anomaly/threat.
	- Consider the article [[Defending-With-IPS-And-IDS]]
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) - Inspects traffic to block the exfiltration of data - see [[Data-Exfiltration-Defined]]
- Endpoint Protection
- Cloud Security
- [[SIEM-Solutions]]
- Security Orchestration Automation and response (SOAR) - Coordination and automation of task between parties to identify anomalies, threat and vbulnerabilities.
- Network Traffic Analysis & Network Detection and Response - Inspecting network traffic or traffic capture to identify anomalies and threats.
