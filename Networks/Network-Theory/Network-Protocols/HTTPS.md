# HTTPS

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. HTTPS is encrypted to increase the overall security of data communication between clients and the server. All [[HTTP]] traffic should use HTTPS, plaintext packets are human readable, but also malicious [[JavaScript]] can be inserted by an attacker listening to the communication, which can lead to [[Client-Side-Attacks]]or [[Man-In-The-Browser-Attacks]]. HTTPS also provides some protection from network tempering, such as a man-in-the-middle. Tools such as [[Ettercap]] or NetHunter Man In The Middle ([[MITM-Attacks]]) Framework are used for this kind of attack.
