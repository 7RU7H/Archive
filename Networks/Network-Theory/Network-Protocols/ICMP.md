# ICMP

The Internet Control Messaging Protocol (ICMP) operates at the Transport layer of TCP/IP. It plays a crucial support function: when there is a problem with the reception of data, it alerts the sender with various kinds of error messages. It generally does not transmit data itself, aside from these error codes.


```bash
ping
```

ICMP can be used to in Exfiltration: [[Data-Exfiltration-Over-ICMP]]
