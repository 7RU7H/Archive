[Wikipedia IPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Printing_Protocol) states: *"The **Internet Printing Protocol** (**IPP**) is a specialized [communication protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") for communication between client devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc.) and printers (or [print servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_server "Print server")). It allows clients to submit one or more [print jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_job "Print job") to the network-attached printer or print server, and perform tasks such as querying the status of a [printer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printer_(computing) "Printer (computing)"), obtaining the status of print jobs, or cancelling individual print jobs."*
