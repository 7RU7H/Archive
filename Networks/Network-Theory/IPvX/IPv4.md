# IPv4

# Research required these are just notes..


Every IPv4 address will have a corresponding `subnet mask`
`network` & `host` portion of an IP address.


**Beware the subnet mask**


/28 is not /16 !!

When network traffic is destined for an IP address located in a different network, the computer will send the traffic to its assigned `default gateway`.

The default gateway is usually the IP address assigned to a NIC on an appliance acting as the router for a given LAN.
