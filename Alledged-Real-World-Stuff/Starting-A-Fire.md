# Ancient Fire starting

Its all about HEAT generation and retention

Bang two stones to create a flake (hybrid knife tool)

Prepare:

0. Collect dry wood materials (if push your nail into the wood leaves a mark it is good (not sappy wood) wood.
1. Stone mount that is dry to prevent loss of heat to the ground
2. Dry Bark or grass for kindling
3. ~ Inch thick board that knotches for rotating the hand drill that create dust that will eventually make a coal
4. A solid curved piece of bark to catch the dust and retain it to form a coal
5. A thicker than a regular pencil sized drill to create dust and heat

If possible a bow drill can be made with string to wrap around the drill (use a stone or chunk on top to provide downward motion to the drill). This increases the time the drill is rotating to retain heat generation. 

Otherwise, wet hands and start with the drill a lowest part of one hand and rotate it fully to generate as many rotations as possible before rotating the opposite direction.
