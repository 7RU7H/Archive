# Black Holes

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole"): *"A [black hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole") is an object with a gravitational field that is sufficiently powerful that it can prevent light from escaping. When they are formed from the collapse of a rotating mass, they retain all of the angular momentum that is not shed in the form of ejected gas. This rotation causes the space within an oblate spheroid-shaped volume, called the "ergosphere", to be dragged around with the black hole. Mass falling into this volume gains energy by this process and some portion of the mass can then be ejected without falling into the black hole. When the mass is ejected, the black hole loses angular momentum (the "[Penrose process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_process "Penrose process")")."*
