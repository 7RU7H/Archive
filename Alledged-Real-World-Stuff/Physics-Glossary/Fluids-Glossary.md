# Fluids Glossary

#### Relative Density

Relationship between the density of one substance and the density of another that is taken as a reference

#### Specific Weight

Weight of one substance per unit volume

#### Specific Volume 

Volume per unit mass of a material

#### Volume 

Space occupied by a body

#### Pressure

Pressure is a force exerted perpendicular to its surface

Absolute pressure: force per unit, which a body is subjected, measured with reference to absolute.	


Pasal's Law: The pressure exerted on a incompressible fluid will spread exactly throughout the container containing the fluid


Dynamic Pressure:
- Associated with fluid movement
- Dependent on density and speed
- Measured against fluid flow


Static Pressure:
- Pressure that a fluid has regardless of its speed measured in the wall of a duct through which it flow

Gauge Pressure:
- The difference between absolute pressure and atmospheric pressure

#### Archimedes Principle

WIKI

Buoyant force: body immersed in fluid at rest, this force a vertical and upward thrust equal to weight of the fluid dislodged by the body


#### Flow rate

Volume flow rate: volume of fluid passing through a cross section in a given time

Weight flow rate: weight of a fluid passing through a cross section in a given time

Mass flow rate: amount of mass passing through a cross section in a given time

#### Equation of Continuity

Liquids state aggregation of matter:
- Shape adapt to a container
- Force attraction is less than solids

Gas state aggregation of matter:
- Adapts to the container
- Attractive force in weak - tends to expand

#### Bernoulli Equation

When an ideal fluid (has neither viscosity nor friction), is circulating through a closed conduit, its energy will remain constant throughout the entire trajectory.


#### General Energy Equation

#### Pump and Engine power

Hydraulic Engine: Device that transforms mechanical energy into hydraulic energy

Hydraulic Engine: Device that transforms fluid kinetic energy into rotatory mechanical energy

##### Reynolds Number and Energy Loss


Friction factor: dimensionless parameter used to calculate the energy loss in a tube due to friction 

Laminar flow: Movement of a fluid characterised  by being orderly and smooth

Turbulent flow: Movement of fluid characterised by being irregular, chaotic and unpredictable

Kinetic viscosity: Relationship between dynamic viscosity and fluid density

Dynamic viscosity: resistance of a fluid to shear force while in motion. It is the relationship between the shear stress and the velocity gradient.
