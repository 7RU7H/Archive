#### Periodic Motion

Cyclic repeated movement
- Period
- Frequency
- Angular Frequency
#### Period

Time taken to complete a full cycle

#### Frequency

`Nth` times a cycle per unit of time (second ) FORMULIES?

#### Angular Frequency

Frequency of cyclic motion expressed depending on the angle change

#### Harmonic Motion

Periodic motion describing a particle that has been subjected to a restoring force proportional to a displacement


#### Hook's Law

Elongation experienced by a spring in direct proportional to force applied to the spring


#### Angular Harmonic Motion 
- Period
- Frequency
- Angular Frequency
- Phase Angle 

#### Phase Angle 

Phase differential between two sinusoidal values (quantities) FORMULIES?

#### Amplitude

Maximum height of a wave

#### Spring Constant

Amount of force required by a spring to move it a unitary distance

#### Moment of Inertia

Resistance that a rigid body has in rotation to the change in motion

#### Pendulum

Pendulum variables:
- Period (full cycle)
- Frequency (`x` cycles per unit of time)
- Angular Frequency
- Spring Constant
- Mass 
- Length
- Acceleration of Gravity

Physical Pendulums

Sine Wave: is a wave pattern mathematical functions sine and cosine

#### Wave Number

Inverse of a Wave Length, the number of cycles of a wave in a unit of distance

#### Wave Length

Inverse of a Wave Number, is the distance that a wave travels in a cycle around and between two consecutive ridges and valleys - FORMULIE?

#### Wave Intensity

Amount of energy that propagates per unit time through a unit area traverses to the direction of propagation of the wave. Power per unit Area.

#### Acceleration 

Change in Velocity over time 

#### Tension 

Physical phenomena in which a body is subjected to two opposing forces


#### Gravity

Acceleration of Gravity is the acceleration produced by the Gravitational attraction force that propels bodies towards the a Gravitational centre 
#### Mass

Amount of matter in a body


#### Standing/Stationary Waves - FORMULIE?

- Wave Number
- Wave Length
- Period (full cycle)
- Frequency (`x` cycles per unit of time)
- Angular Frequency
- Amplitude 
- Tension
- Time
- Acceleration
- Velocity
- Fundamental Frequency

Stationary Waves: form with the interference of two or more waves of equal amplitude and wavelength, which move in opposite directions on a medium producing a fixed node - FORMULIE

#### Fundamental Frequency

The lowest frequency of the periodic wave

#### Sound

Sound is a physical phenomena caused by the propagation of mechanical waves

Doppler Effect: Frequency variation that presents a sound wave when the source that produces it and the receiver that capture it move away or approach each other

#### Density 

The amount of mass in a given volume 


#### Temperature

Internal energy that a body possesses
