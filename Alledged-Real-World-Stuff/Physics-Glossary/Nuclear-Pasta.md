[Wikipedia Nuclear Pasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pasta) *"is a theoretical type of [degenerate matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter "Degenerate matter") that is postulated to exist within the crusts of [neutron stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star")... [nuclear attraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force "Nuclear interaction") and [Coulomb repulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_repulsion "Coulomb repulsion") interactions are of comparable magnitude. The competition between the interactions leads to the formation of a variety of complex structures assembled from [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") and [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton")."*
