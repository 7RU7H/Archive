#### Newton's Laws

#### Kepler's Laws


#### Vector

It is a line segment composed of:
- Modulas
- Direction
- Sense

#### Motion with constant velocity

Motion with constant and a straight path - FORMULIE?

#### Instantaneous Velocity

Change that a position experiences at every moment over time

#### Average Velocity 

Quantity that describes the displacement in a time interval

#### Motion with constant acceleration

Motion that describes a body with constant acceleration and straight path

#### Instant acceleration

Change that experiences at every moment speed through time - FORMULIE?

#### Free Fall

Free Fall consists of a uniformly accelerating downward motion, is result of gravity and has positive movement - FORMULIE?


#### Acceleration of Gravity

Acceleration that is the result of the gravitational attraction force propelling bodies towards a centre of Gravity

#### Vertical motion

- Velocity
- Time
- Acceleration of Gravity

Consists of a uniformly accelerating upward rectilinear motion. The acceleration is given by the action of gravity and is negative (against the movement)


#### Projectile Motion

- Velocity
- Time
- Acceleration of Gravity

Movement made by a body whose trajectory describe a parabola. It is composed of horizontal uniform rectilinear motion and a vertical uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion.

#### Uniform Circular Motion

Motion that describes a body with constant acceleration and circular path

#### Angular velocity

Change that experiences an angle over time.

#### Tangential velocity

It is the result from product of angular velocity by radius. It's tangent to the trajectory

#### Centripetal acceleration 

It originates from circular motion and is directed towards the centre of the circumference, caused by centipede force and is perpendicular to speed of body


#### Work

Work is done when a force is applied to a body and moves a certain distance

#### Energy

The capability to do work - manifests in physical and chemical changes

Kinetic energy
Mechanical energy
Potential energy

#### Power

Amount of work per unit of time (how quickly a body does work)

#### Force

Physical ability to energy change the state of rest or movement of a body


#### Uniform circular motion

- Work
- Energy
- Power
- Mass
- Acceleration
- Time
- Force
- Velocity
- Displacement 
- Spring Constant
- Acceleration of gravity


#### Const acceleration circular motion

Motion that describes a body with constant acceleration and circular path

- Angular velocity
- Angular acceleration
- Time

#### Tangential acceleration

It results from the product of angular acceleration by radius and is tangential to the trajectory

#### Linear momentum and collisions

?

#### Impulse

Magnitude that represents the variation of linear moment that a body experiences

#### Collision

- Force
- Mass Acceleration
- Velocity
- Time
- Kinetic Energy

An event in which more that two bodies interact, where at least one is moving, which both exerting force with each other

#### Elastic collision 

Type of collision where linear moment and kinetic energy are preserved and there is no mass exchange

#### Perfectly inelastic collision

Type of collision where final speed in the same for both kinetic energy is not preserved and can suffer deformations

#### Rotation Dynamics

- Force
- Mass Acceleration
- Velocity
- Angular Velocity
- Angular Acceleration
- Tangential Force
- Displacement

#### Dynamics

Subject domain of mechanics focused on movement and its causes

#### Torque

Vector magnitude that is the product of the vector position where force is applied by force vector

#### Work

It is done when a force is applied to a body and it moves a certain distance

#### Power 

Amount of work per unit of time

##### Centre of Mass

Point of a body that behaves are if the resultant of all external forces acting on it were applied there

#### Moment of inertia

Resistance that a rigid body has in rotation to the change in movement

#### Angular momentum

It is analogies to the linear moment in translation

#### Static equilibrium and elasticity

- Equilibrium
- Stress
- Deformation
- Area
- Length
- Shear Modulus
- Modulus of elasticity
- Bulk modulus
- Pressure
#### Equilibrium


FORMULIE?

#### Stress

Force applied over a given area

#### Shear modulus

Parameters that indicate the resistance of a material to deformation by shear stress

#### Modulus of elasticity

Measure of the elastic capacity of a material

#### Bulk modulus

Parameter that indicates the strength of a material to change to its volume 
#### Pressure

Force exert in perpendicular duration on a surfaces
