#### Level Repulsion

[Wikipedia - Level Repulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_repulsion) *"Level repulsion is the [quantum mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanical "Quantum mechanical") equivalent to a repulsion effect in [oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillator "Oscillator")"*.

#### Dualities

Refered to in papers as Dualities, [Wikipedia Wave–particle duality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality) states it is the concept in [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") that fundamental entities of the universe, like [photons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") and [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), exhibit [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle "Particle") or [wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_\(physics\) "Wave (physics)") properties according to the experimental circumstances.
