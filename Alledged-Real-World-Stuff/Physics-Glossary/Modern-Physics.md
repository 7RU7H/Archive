Relativity attempts to explain space and time as relative concepts - proof unable to find absolute reference point

Photoelectric effect: emission of electrons by material when hit with electromagnetic radiation

Compton Scattering: when photons hit with a free electron a photon's wave length increases and loses energy

Photon: An elemental particle that carries all forms of electromagnetic radiation (including visible light) and has no mass or electric charge

Work function: minimum amount of energy needed to induce Photo-emission of electrons

Atom: smallest structure of matter (with properties of a chemical element), indivisible consisting of:
- Nuleus at the centre (with positive charge)
	- Nuclear decay: disintegration of Nucleus
	- Nuclide: determinant amount of protons and neutrons
	- Half life: Average time of life of a Nucleus (or subatomic particles)
- Protons
- Neutrons 
- Electrons (with negative charge)


Electron Capture

[Wikipedia Electron Capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture): proton-rich nucleus of an electrically neutral ato absorbs an inner atomic electron from the K (1st orbit) or L (2nd orbit) electron shells

[Wikipedia Ionisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization) **Ionization** or **ionisation** is the process by which an [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom "Atom") or a [molecule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule "Molecule") acquires a negative or positive [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") by gaining or losing [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron "Electron"), often in conjunction with other chemical changes.


[Wikipedia Physics Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_(physics))In [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), a **field** is a [physical quantity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity "Physical quantity"), represented by a [scalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_\(mathematics\) "Scalar (mathematics)"), [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_\(mathematics_and_physics\) "Vector (mathematics and physics)"), or [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor "Tensor"), that has a value for each [point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_\(geometry\) "Point (geometry)") in [space and time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime").

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)  Plasma is gas that has undergone a degree of Ionisation


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization Ionisation is the process of a atom or molecule to acquire a positive or negative charge by gain or loss of electrons
