Relativity attempts to explain space and time as relative concepts - proof unable to find absolute reference point

Photoelectric effect: emission of electrons by material when hit with electromagnetic radiation

Compton Scattering: when photons hit with a free electron a photon's wave length increases and loses energy

Photon: An elemental particle that carries all forms of electromagnetic radiation (including visible light) and has no mass or electric charge

Work function: minimum amount of energy needed to induce Photo-emission of electrons

Atom: smallest structure of matter (with properties of a chemical element), indivisible consisting of:
- Nuleus at the centre (with positive charge)
	- Nuclear decay: disintegration of Nucleus
	- Nuclide: determinant amount of protons and neutrons
	- Half life: Average time of life of a Nucleus (or subatomic particles)
- Protons
- Neutrons 
- Electrons (with negative charge)
