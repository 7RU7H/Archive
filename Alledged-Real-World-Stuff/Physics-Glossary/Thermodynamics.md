# Thermodynamics


#### Temperature

Temperature: internal energy that a body possesses
- 0-100 degrees Celsius: melting and boiling point of water
- 0-100 degrees Fahrenheit: melting and boiling point of ammonium chloride in water
- K Kelvin: Absolute temperature scale in the SI, based on degrees Calsius 0 is Absolute 0
- 0Ra Degrees Rankine: Fahrenheit above absolute zero
- 0RE  80RE Degrees Reaumur: Unused temperature unit - freezing and evaporation point of water


#### Thermal Expansion

Thermal Expansion:  body increase in length, surface or volume due to temperature increase
- Linear Thermal Expansion:
	- In 2 Dimensions = Area increase
	- In 4 Dimensions = Volume increase
- Coefficient of Linear Expansion  
	- Length increase of a unit length of material per one degree - FORMULIE?
- Coefficient of Volume Expansion
	- Length increase of a unit length of material per one degree - FORMULIE?


#### Thermal Stress

Stress to a body caused by thermal expansion or contraction due to temperature
#### Heat Transfer

Conduction: is the heat transfer through direct contact between bodies

Radiation: Emission of energy produced by some bodies in the form of electromagnetic waves

Thermal conductivity: Amount of heat flowing through a surface, unit of material, time and temperature differential - FORMALIE?

Emissivity coefficient: Dimensionless number that relates the ability of a real body to radiant thermal energy, with respect to to the ability to radiate if it were a black body - FORMULIE?

#### Quantity of Heat

Heat: Energy that is transferred from one body to another when there is a temperature difference between them

Specific Heat: Amount of heat needed for a gram of a substance to increase in temperature 
by one degree

#### Phase changes

Latent heat of Fusion: Energy needed for a substance to change phase from solid to liquid 

Latent heat of Vaporisation : Energy needed for a substance to change phase from liquid to gaseous 
#### Ideal Gas Laws

Boyle's Law: Relation between the pressure and volume of a gas at constant temperature

Charles's Law: Relation between the volume and temperature of a gas at constant pressure

Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure: The total pressure of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each gas


Gay-Lussac's Law: Relates to the pressure and temperature of a gas at constant volume
