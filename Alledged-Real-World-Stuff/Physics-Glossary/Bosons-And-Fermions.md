[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon) *"A **gluon** ([/ˈɡluːɒn/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [_GLOO-on_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key")) is a type of [massless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massless_particle "Massless particle") [elementary particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle "Elementary particle") that mediates the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction "Strong interaction") between [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark "Quark"), acting as the [exchange particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_particle "Exchange particle") for the interaction. Gluons are massless [vector bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_boson "Vector boson"), thereby having a [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_\(physics\) "Spin (physics)") of 1.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon#cite_note-7) Through the strong interaction, gluons bind quarks into groups according to [quantum chromodynamics (QCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics "Quantum chromodynamics"), forming [hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron "Hadron") such as [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton") and [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron"). Gluons carry the [color charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge "Color charge") of the strong interaction, thereby participating in the strong interaction as well as mediating it. Because gluons carry the color charge, QCD is more difficult to analyze compared to [quantum electrodynamics (QED)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics "Quantum electrodynamics") where the [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon "Photon") carries no electric charge. The term was coined by [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann "Murray Gell-Mann") in 1962[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon#cite_note-9) for being similar to an [adhesive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive "Adhesive") or glue that keeps the nucleus together.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon#cite_note-10) Together with the quarks, these particles were referred to as [partons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parton_\(particle_physics\) "Parton (particle physics)") by [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman").[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon#cite_note-11)*

Gluon are a [Wikipedia Vector boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_boson) states vector boson as a [boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson "Boson") whose [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_\(physics\) "Spin (physics)") equals one. In relation to the Higgs Boson - the [W and Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons "W and Z bosons") particles interact with the Higgs boson as shown in the [Feynman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram).
