# Optics Glossary

#### Reflection 

Change in direction of a wave when it contacts a surface

#### Refraction

Change in direction to a wave when it passes obliquely from one medium to another with a different refractive index

#### Index of Refraction

Relationship between:
- Sine of the angle of incidence 
- Sine of the angle of refraction


#### Angle of incidence

Angle formed by a ray of light and the normal to the surface where its hits

#### Angle of reflection 

Angle formed by a reflected beam of light and the normal to surface

#### Polarisation

Brewster's law: when a beam of light hits the separation surface of two mediums, one portion is reflected back and another is refracted with respect to the Index of Refraction

#### Geometric Optics

Geometric Optics: study of light rays, neglecting the effects of said rays and wave motion

#### Interference

Constructive inference: superposition of two or more waves of the same frequency, which when they interfere form a wave greater amplitude and are in phase 


Destructive Interference: superposition of two or more waves of the same frequency, which when they interfere form a wave of lower amplitude and are out of phase

#### Phase

Phase Angle: phase differential between two sinusoidal quantities 

#### Diffraction

The phenomena that occurs when a wave an obstacle of slit and then deviates in trajectory
