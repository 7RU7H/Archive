# Neutron Stars

A [neutron star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star") is a highly dense remnant of a star that is primarily composed of [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron")—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of a neutron star is in the range of 1.2 to 2.1 times the [mass of the Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_mass "Solar mass"). As a result of the collapse, a newly formed neutron star can have a very rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second. [Pulsars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar "Pulsar") are rotating neutron stars that have a magnetic field. A narrow beam of [electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation "Electromagnetic radiation") is emitted from the poles of rotating pulsars. If the beam sweeps past the direction of the Solar System then the pulsar will produce a periodic pulse that can be detected from the Earth. The energy radiated by the magnetic field gradually slows down the rotation rate, so that older pulsars can require as long as several seconds between each pulse.

- [Wikipedia Nuclear Pasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pasta) *"Unlike their progenitor star, neutron stars do not consist of a gaseous plasma. Rather, the intense gravitational attraction of the compact mass overcomes the [electron degeneracy pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure "Electron degeneracy pressure") and causes [electron capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture "Electron capture") to occur within the star.*"
	- [Wikipedia electron degeneracy pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure) is a [quantum mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanical "Quantum mechanical") effect critical to understanding the stability of [white dwarf stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf_stars "White dwarf stars") and [metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal "Metal") solids.
	- degenerate [Fermi–Dirac statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac_statistics "Fermi–Dirac statistics") close to the zero-temperature limit
	- electron degeneracy pressure halts gravitational collapse of a star if its mass is below the [Chandrasekhar limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit "Chandrasekhar limit") (1.44 [solar masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_masses "Solar masses"), exceeding this limit and without significant thermally generated pressure as it will collapse into a black hole or a neutron star the as degeneracy pressure provided by the electrons is weaker than the inward pull of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity").
- The presence of hyperions = `( strange, strange, strange)` should make the interior more squishy not less

	- Palli-exclusion principle = no two neutrons can share the exact same quantum properties -> Schizophrenia disentanglement is possible, but why does it actually happen
	- neutron star are not actually only neutrons

	- TOV limit + planet spin is limit of the size, which is why J0740+6620 is weird 
- "Quark soup or hyperion -> I thought watching the video they both less likely
	- [Wikipedia quark-gluon plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma#Neutron_stars): *"The strength of the [color interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_force "Color interaction") means that unlike the gas-like plasma, quark–gluon plasma behaves as a near-ideal [Fermi liquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_liquid "Fermi liquid"), although research on flow characteristics is ongoing.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma#cite_note-76) Liquid or even near-perfect liquid flow with almost no frictional resistance or viscosity was claimed by research teams at RHIC[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma#cite_note-77) and LHC's [Compact Muon Solenoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Muon_Solenoid "Compact Muon Solenoid") detector.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma#cite_note-78)"*
- [Wikipedia Nuclear Pasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pasta) *"is a theoretical type of [degenerate matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter "Degenerate matter") that is postulated to exist within the crusts of [neutron stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star")... [nuclear attraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force "Nuclear interaction") and [Coulomb repulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_repulsion "Coulomb repulsion") interactions are of comparable magnitude. The competition between the interactions leads to the formation of a variety of complex structures assembled from [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") and [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton")."*
