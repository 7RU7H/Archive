# Neutron Stars

- [Wikipedia Nuclear Pasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pasta) *"Unlike their progenitor star, neutron stars do not consist of a gaseous plasma. Rather, the intense gravitational attraction of the compact mass overcomes the [electron degeneracy pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure "Electron degeneracy pressure") and causes [electron capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture "Electron capture") to occur within the star.*"
	- [Wikipedia electron degeneracy pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure) is a [quantum mechanical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanical "Quantum mechanical") effect critical to understanding the stability of [white dwarf stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf_stars "White dwarf stars") and [metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal "Metal") solids.
	- degenerate [Fermi–Dirac statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%E2%80%93Dirac_statistics "Fermi–Dirac statistics") close to the zero-temperature limit
	- electron degeneracy pressure halts gravitational collapse of a star if its mass is below the [Chandrasekhar limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit "Chandrasekhar limit") (1.44 [solar masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_masses "Solar masses"), exceeding this limit and without significant thermally generated pressure as it will collapse into a black hole or a neutron star the as degeneracy pressure provided by the electrons is weaker than the inward pull of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity "Gravity").
- The presence of hyperions = `( strange, strange, strange)` should make the interior more squishy not less
- Gravity or re-ignition of nuclear fusion
- YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoYjkNQ27T8 
	- Palli-exclusion principle = no two neutrons can share the exact same quantum properties -> Schizophrenia disentanglement is possible, but why does it actually happen
	- neutron star are not actually only neutrons

		- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_J0740%2B6620
	- TOV limit + planet spin is limit of the size, which is why J0740+6620 is weird 
- "Quark soup or hyperion -> I thought watching the video they both less likely
	- [Wikipedia quark-gluon plasma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma#Neutron_stars): *"The strength of the [color interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_force "Color interaction") means that unlike the gas-like plasma, quark–gluon plasma behaves as a near-ideal [Fermi liquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_liquid "Fermi liquid"), although research on flow characteristics is ongoing.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma#cite_note-76) Liquid or even near-perfect liquid flow with almost no frictional resistance or viscosity was claimed by research teams at RHIC[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma#cite_note-77) and LHC's [Compact Muon Solenoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Muon_Solenoid "Compact Muon Solenoid") detector.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma#cite_note-78)"*
- [Wikipedia Nuclear Pasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pasta) *"is a theoretical type of [degenerate matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter "Degenerate matter") that is postulated to exist within the crusts of [neutron stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star "Neutron star")... [nuclear attraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_force "Nuclear interaction") and [Coulomb repulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb_repulsion "Coulomb repulsion") interactions are of comparable magnitude. The competition between the interactions leads to the formation of a variety of complex structures assembled from [neutrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron "Neutron") and [protons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton "Proton")."*
