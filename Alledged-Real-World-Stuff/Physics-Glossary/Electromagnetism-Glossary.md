# Electromagnetism Glossary

Points = nodes (graph theory)

DOUBLE CHECK:
The speed of electricity
- Wire transmission (Depending on wire properties and insulation): `~50 - 90%` the speed of light 
- Electrical Signal (on Copper) `75%` the speed of light 
#### Ampère's Circuital Law

[Wikipedia - Ampère's circuital law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_circuital_law): *Sometimes **Oersted's law** or just Ampere's Law, relates to the [circulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulation_\(physics\) "Circulation (physics)") of a [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field") around a closed loop to the [electric current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current") passing through that loop.*"
- The Magnetic Field in a conductor is proportional to the current that flows through it



#### Ampère's Force Law

[Wikipedia - Ampère's Force Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_force_law): *"In [magnetostatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostatics "Magnetostatics"), **Ampère's force law** describes the force of attraction or repulsion between two [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current")-carrying wires. The physical origin of this force is that each wire generates a [magnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field "Magnetic field"), following the [Biot–Savart law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biot%E2%80%93Savart_law "Biot–Savart law"), and the other wire experiences a magnetic force as a consequence, following the [Lorentz force law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force_law "Lorentz force law")."*


#### Biet-Savart Law

Sets the magnetic field produced by a stationary current at any node

#### Coulomb's Law

- The Electric Force between two nodes is:
	- directly proportional to the **product** of both
	- inversely proportional to the square of the distance between
- The Electric Potential is the difference between two nodes
- The Electric field is the field surrounding node(s) and edge(s)
- Electric Potential Energy is:
	- Physical property of some particle that is a measurement of the level of Electricity present

#### Faraday's Law

The relationship between (In a closed circuit):
- Rate of change in magnetic flux passing through a coil
- Induced voltage
#### Gauss's Law

- The flux of an electrical field through a closed surface is proportional to magnitude of the charge within it

#### Joule Effect

Phenomena when electric current circulates through conductor a portion of the kinetic energy that electrons have is transformed into heat 
```
Q = I^2Rt
```

#### Kirchoff's Laws

- Current Law: 
	- At a node the `sum of currents entering it is == to sum of total current leaving is 0`
- Voltages Law:
	- In a closed circuit the sum of all voltages drops is equal to the total voltage supplied. The Algebriac sum of voltage drops in the circuit is `==` 0


#### Ohm's Law

Describes the relationship between **`Voltage = Current * Resistence`** or 

```
V = IR
```

#### Lorentz's Law

Establishes:
- Force exerted by a magnetic field as a charge that circulates at a certain speed



#### Capacitance

The capability of a material to store energy (in the form of Electrical charge)

#### Magnetic Field

A vector produced by the current flowing through a conductor

#### Magnetic Flux

Total magnetic field passing through an area. It is a measurement of the amount of magnetism 

#### Magnetic Force

Force that produces a magnetic flux between two nodes

#### Electric Charge

Physical property of some particles that measures the level of electricity present

#### Electrical Permittivity 

Physical parameter that describes the response of a medium to the presence of an Electrical Field. It is the relationship between the electric displacement and the intensity of the Electric Field

#### Flux 

Flux is measurement of how much of a field passes through a given circuit

#### Magnitude in Electromagnetism

Magnitude in electromagnetism concerns:
- Electric Field Magnitude
- Magnetic Field Magnitude
- Electromagnetic Force (Lorentz Force)
- Electric Potential Magnitude
- Vector Magnitude

Quantum Magnitude the combined bodies Quantum entanglement affect of both decoherence and interference on a body and its forces over time.
