# Surviving with Nothing

After some festive cognitive dissonance watching some of Castaway with family. I decided to make sure I would retain all the Video Game knowledge on survival and bolster it with expertise from real Survivalists.  

## Basics

1. Recon and material gathering
2. Find a place
3. Make a flake (hybrid knife too) 
4. Fire -> [[Starting-A-Fire]]
5. Make Wooden pots and tubes
6. Boil water with hot stones in wood pot and boil and water steam goes through tubes (bark strip wrapped to create a tube the funnels into another wooden pot
