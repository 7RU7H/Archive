1. How much money do you want to make?
2. How fast do you want to make that money?
3. How much money do you have right now?

Everything you want o achieve is mathematically constrained by annual rate of return formula:
```
[(Ending money/Starting money)^(1/n years) - 1 ]* 100%
```

As the business grows the annual rate of return will always go down

1. Calculate its balance sheet, cash flow and income statement
2. Calculate the GAAP/IFRS compliant earnings per share
3. File corporate income tax return with audited trial balance with appropriate adjusting journal entries
	 - Remember the intrinsic relationship of `0 = retained_earning_beginning + (revenue - expenses_wo_tax - corperate_tax - dividends - (assets - liabilities) + share_capital`
	 - Avoid confusing GAAP account with acrruel account, tax accounting and balance sheet accounting]
4. Build reputation and strong customer relations; then track customers in a CRM system
5. Consider marketing
	- Customer acquisition cost
	- Customer life time value
	- Customer churn rate
6. Legal contract 
	- Indemnification clause
	- Provision for Force Majeure
	- Binding Arbitration 
	- Ensure contract is Non-Exclusive and Assignable to Sub-Contractors
	- Termination clause
	- Governing Jurisdiction
